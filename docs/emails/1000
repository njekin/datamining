No, I really don't. I'm on my own, so I've just been piecing it together over the past few years. If you could help me out with that too, it would be great! I'd really like for everything to match and look professional. That's all I am really concerned about.

Thanks for your help,
Erica

	Hi Boone,
	
	My name is Erica Rust, and I am a friend of Callie. She told me that you are
	starting up a new personalized stationery business and that you would be
	able to give me a good deal on some stationery for my business. I am a solo
	practitioner attorney, and I work out of my home. I am in need of several
	types of stationery. First, I need some general stationery to print letters.
	These letters will be sent to clients, other attorneys, and courts. Second,
	I need some note cards that I can write personal, handwritten messages on.
	Finally, I need some holiday greeting cards to send to my clients and
	colleagues. I would like something simple and cheap, yet professional. I
	would probably need about 1,000 sheets of general stationery, 200 note
	cards, and 100 holiday cards. Please tell me what other information I need
	to get you. My contact info is below.
	
	Thank you in advance for your help,
	Erica
