Thank you for your inquiry. I can put together a few samples for you to choose from. Do you have a letterhead or logo you would like to like to use on the stationery? Thank you for your business.

Boone

Hi Boone,

My name is Erica Rust, and I am a friend of Callie. She told me that you are
starting up a new personalized stationery business and that you would be
able to give me a good deal on some stationery for my business. I am a solo
practitioner attorney, and I work out of my home. I am in need of several
types of stationery. First, I need some general stationery to print letters.
These letters will be sent to clients, other attorneys, and courts. Second,
I need some note cards that I can write personal, handwritten messages on.
Finally, I need some holiday greeting cards to send to my clients and
colleagues. I would like something simple and cheap, yet professional. I
would probably need about 1,000 sheets of general stationery, 200 note
cards, and 100 holiday cards. Please tell me what other information I need
to get you. My contact info is below.

Thank you in advance for your help,
Erica
