Hi Boone,

My name is Erica Rust, and I am a friend of Callie. She told me that you are starting up a new personalized stationery business and that you would be able to give me a good deal on some stationery for my business. I am a solo practitioner attorney, and I work out of my home. I am in need of several types of stationery. First, I need some general stationery to print letters. These letters will be sent to clients, other attorneys, and courts. Second, I need some note cards that I can write personal, handwritten messages on. Finally, I need some holiday greeting cards to send to my clients and colleagues. I would like something simple and cheap, yet professional. I would probably need about 1,000 sheets of general stationery, 200 note cards, and 100 holiday cards. Please tell me what other information I need to get you. My contact info is below.

Thank you in advance for your help,
Erica
