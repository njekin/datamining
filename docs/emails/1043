Yeah, it sounded like a nice weekend. It was beautiful in Knox today too! I really, really, really didn't want to do my homework.

It was also sweltering hot in Athens today. It was a bit miserable, to be honest with you. I've also got a super-sweet sunglasses tan.

We're still waiting to hear back from them, but at least it looks like I will get significantly more than they started with.

I just wanted to tell you about the settlement stuff but I think we covered it at lunch. I'll feed you updates as I get them from nathan.

I've got some important things to ask you about the old business and the new business. You know that you're the only person I trust and I haven't been able to get in touch with you. Did you already head down to GA?
