I just wanted to tell you about the settlement stuff but I think we covered it at lunch. I'll feed you updates as I get them from nathan.

I've got some important things to ask you about the old business and the new business. You know that you're the only person I trust and I haven't been able to get in touch with you. Did you already head down to GA?
