I believed it could happen when clay travis picked it. It was a great game. I'm just disappointed sc didn't let the students rush the field. First win over a number one in history. I say pay the fine let the kids have the memory

And how about that Alabama - South Carolina game today? I would not have picked SC to be the team to beat Bama. I have mixed feelings about it. I really despise Bama, but I hate to see Spurrier win. I also hate that we may not have an SEC team in the national championship now. It's bittersweet. But maybe worth it that all the Bama fans are so upset :)

We're still waiting to hear back from them, but at least it looks like I will get significantly more than they started with.

I just wanted to tell you about the settlement stuff but I think we covered it at lunch. I'll feed you updates as I get them from nathan.

I've got some important things to ask you about the old business and the new business. You know that you're the only person I trust and I haven't been able to get in touch with you. Did you already head down to GA?
