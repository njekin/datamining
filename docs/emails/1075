Hopefully there will be another 80 degree, gorgeous day next week. I'd love to do lunch on the square again.

I'm so glad we got to do lunch today! It's is absolutely beautiful outside, and it was the perfect day to eat on the Square. I LOVE fall. And I love "lunching" with you :)

Are we still on for tomorrow? I'm all set to make my deadlines and be able to relax all afternoon with you before you head out of town.
