1.    Illiterate Clown Elected to Congress 
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/illiterate-clown-elected-to-congr 
ess.html> 

In a development that must be raising the spirits of many American 
candidates, an inexperienced, illiterate clown has won a landslide 
victory <http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39495001/ns/world_news-americas/> 
in Brazil's congressional elections. 


<http://kevinunderhill.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451bd4469e2013487f6add9970c 
-popup> Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva, whose clown name is Tiririca 
("Grumpy"), got more than 1.3 million votes, more than twice the number 
of votes received by his next closest competitor. How did he do it? With 
complete honesty. 

"What does a congressman do?" Grumpy said in campaign ads. "The truth is 
I don't know. But vote for me and I'll [find out and] tell you." He 
promised, in fact, to do nothing during his term other than finding out 
what they do in Congress and telling the voters about it, and voters 
seemed to think that was a great idea. Or they may have been swayed by 
Grumpy's slogan: "It can't get any worse!" 

They certainly did not care that someone probably came up with this 
slogan for him, or at least wrote it down for him. Grumpy (shown to the 
right celebrating the complete breakdown of Brazilian political culture) 
survived a last-minute try by public prosecutors to disqualify him on 
the grounds of illiteracy, and as noted went on to a landslide victory. 

This will very likely turn out to be a boon for other candidates as 
well, at least those in Grumpy's coalition. Under Brazilian law, a 
candidate's "excess votes" can apparently be passed on to other 
affiliated candidates, so they will have approximately 650,000 reasons 
to be glad they had an illiterate clown on the ticket.

2.    Legal Drama Finally Pleads Guilty to Sucking 
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/outlaw-finally-pleads-guilty-to-s 
ucking.html> 

Entertainment Weekly reports 
<http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/10/06/nbc-drama-outlaw-goes-on-prod 
uction-hiatus/>  that NBC has halted production on Outlaw, its new legal 
drama starring Jimmy Smits as a conservative but hard-partying Supreme 
Court justice with a gambling problem who resigns from the Court to go 
into private practice as a liberal defense attorney. 

Yet another legal show with plots "ripped from the headlines." 

Let's see if the reviews can provide some sort of clue as to why 
production of Outlaw has been stopped after just three episodes. The 
show has been described as: 

*       "overblown" (NYT) 
*       "idiotic" (NY Post) 
*       "jaw-droppingly simple-minded" (Variety) 
*       a "near-parody of [other] law shows" (EW) 
*       possibly "the most preposterous show of the fall" (Boston 
Herald) 
*       "either cynical manipulation or just plain silly" (LA Times) 
*       "so ludicrously dumb that your eyeballs will hurt from rolling 
so much" (Wash. Post) 
*       "the biggest lawyer joke of all" (Miami Herald) 
*       a "piece of sh*t" (Above the Law) 
*       and -- the only one of the many law-related puns that was any 
good -- "guilty by reason of inanity" (TV Guide). 

The show is not quite dead - the network apparently has five episodes 
already in the can, so if America suddenly falls in love with Outlaw, 
production could still resume. Although at this point, that seems about 
as likely as the show's premise.

3.    Hotel Sued After Employee Caught Wearing Guest's Underwear 
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/hotel-sued-after-employee-caught- 
wearing-guests-underwear.html> 

Opinions vary about how much you should tip hotel employees, but in this 
situation, there is general agreement that it should be zero dollars. 

A Los Angeles woman is suing the Hyatt hotel chain, alleging that she 
returned to her room at a Hyatt in Deerfield, Illinois, to find a male 
Hyatt employee wearing some of her clothes. According to the report 
<http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2010/10/hotel-guest-claims-male-empl 
oyee-wore-her-underwear.html> , Dayanara Fernandez alleges that the man 
was wearing a Hyatt shirt along with one of her skirts and a pair of her 
high heels, and, most creepily, her underwear. "After changing his 
clothes," the report continues, the man handed her various items of 
clothing, including several pairs of her underwear," which she 
presumably burned immediately. 

Fernandez called the front desk (and that's a conversation I would like 
to have heard), and they called police. The report cites Lake County 
court records showing that the man later pleaded guilty to a disorderly 
conduct charge and was fined $187. 

Fernandez's attorney was quoted as saying that she had tried to settle 
the claim, but that Hyatt was unwilling to acknowledge her client's 
emotional distress. The complaint alleges claims for emotional distress; 
invasion of privacy; and negligent hiring, supervision and/or training, 
a claim that I suppose means this case could set a precedent requiring 
hotel chains to train their employees not to wear guests' underpants. 

I'm sure that, somewhere, a consultant stands ready to advise them as to 
just how they might do that. 

In a hopefully unrelated story, we are staying at a Hyatt (in Arizona) 
for our partner retreat this weekend.  So far, everything seems to be 
fine, but I don't think everyone has been back to their rooms yet.

4.    Another Reason Not to Wear Sagging Pants: They Won't Stop Bullets 
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/another-reason-not-to-wear-saggin 
g-pants-they-wont-stop-bullets.html> 

A couple of weeks ago, I made fun of the city council of Dublin, Georgia 
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/09/georgia-town-enters-fight-against 
-sagging-pants.html> , which had passed a bill banning pants that sag 
more than three inches below the "crest of the ilium," exposing the 
buttocks or underwear, and justified this in part because of alleged 
evidence "that wearing sagging pants is injurious to the health of the 
wearer as it causes an improper gait." Well, it turns out that this can 
be injurious to the health of the wearer, but not because of its effect 
on the gait. If the wearer is within range of Kenneth Bonds, at least, 
said wearer may find himself with one (1) or more bullets lodged 
somewhere below the crest of the ilium. 

Come to think of it, that might have a pretty dramatic effect on your 
gait. 

Bonds, of Memphis, Tennessee, was arrested and charged with aggravated 
assault 
<http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/oct/04/memphis-man-shoots-tee 
n-who-refuses-pull-saggy-pan/>  recently after he shot a 17-year-old 
low-pants wearer in the butt.  Reportedly, the victim and a 16-year-old 
friend were walking near Bonds' house when Bonds began yelling at them 
to pull their pants up. The boys ignored him, which made Bonds even 
angrier, and they did not improve his mood by then calling him a "fat 
ass" who needed to shut up. Unfortunately for them, the (alleged) fat 
ass had a handgun, and he fired off several shots at the boys as they 
ran away. 

It is possible, but not confirmed, that the boys' escape was hampered by 
the ridiculous sagging pants they were wearing, but whether that was a 
factor or not, one of the bullets intersected with the 17-year-old's 
buttocks. The wound was not critical and the boy was treated and 
released. He was subsequently able to limp into the station and pick 
Bonds out of a lineup. 

Obviously, this could have been much more serious, and there is even 
less justification for using violence to raise waistlines than there is 
for trying to do it through legislation. My basic position hasn't 
changed: "saggers" should pull their pants up, but everybody else should 
stand down.

5.    Pirate Loose in Law Firm 
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/pirate-loose-in-law-firm.html> 

Or at least that's what I infer from this email, forwarded to me this 
week from a Midwestern law firm [not mine] by one who wishes to remain 
anonymous:

I found a skull & crossbones eye patch on this floor.  It's at my desk 
if anyone wants to claim it. 

Halloween is almost a month away, and Litigate Like a Pirate Day has 
already passed, but I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation 
for this.

6.    Seventh Circuit: Plaintiff Unhappy With Search Results Can't Sue 
Yahoo! 
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/plaintiff-unhappy-with-search-res 
ults-cant-sue-yahoo-seventh-circuit-rules.html> 

"Like many," this opinion begins, "Beverly Stayart was curious about 
what she would find when she put her name into a search engine." And 
like many, Beverly Stayart was not happy with what she found. Unlike 
anybody else, however, Beverly Stayart sued the search engine company, 
claiming that the results associated with her name falsely gave the 
impression that she personally endorsed the products and services 
listed, including various pharmaceuticals and what the Seventh Circuit 
called websites promoting certain kinds of "escapades." On September 30, 
the court affirmed the dismissal of Stayart's claim. 

Stayart sued under Section 43(a) of the federal Lanham Act, which 
prohibits false advertising, false claims of endorsement, and so on. Her 
problem was that a Lanham Act claim requires a showing that the 
plaintiff has a "commercial interest" to protect, and Stayart did not 
have a commercial interest in her own name. 

Stayart argued that she had indeed developed a commercial interest in 
her name by virtue of her extensive "Internet presence," specifically 
her "humanitarian efforts on behalf of baby seals, wolves, and wild 
horses; what she describes as 'scholarly posts' on a website; two poems 
that appear on a Danish website; and genealogy research." But while 
these activities might have been "passionate and well-intentioned," the 
court said, they were not "commercial." (Her argument also would have 
given pretty much anybody the ability to use the Lanham Act, unless it 
is more difficult than I think it is to get one of your poems on a 
Danish website.) 

She also argued that other non-profit organizations had been held to 
have a commercial interest for purposes of the Act, but that was under a 
different section that requires the plaintiff to have a "registered 
mark." Since Beverly had apparently not trademarked her name (although 
her attorney did claim at oral argument that she was the only "Beverly 
Stayart" in the country), that didn't work, either. 

In April, Stayart sued Google 
<http://www.popehat.com/2010/04/26/beverly-bev-stayart-must-think-the-wo 
rds-serial-litigant-and-don-quixote-are-prettier-than-cialis-or-levitra/ 
>  on essentially the same grounds, and sooner or later, will get 
essentially the same result.

"After changing his</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>clothes," the report continues, the man handed her various items of</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>clothing, including several pairs of her underwear," which she</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>presumably burned immediately.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>Fernandez called the front desk (and that's a conversation I would like</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>to have heard), and they called police. The report cites Lake County</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>court records showing that the man later pleaded guilty to a disorderly</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>conduct charge and was fined $187.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>Fernandez's attorney was quoted as saying that she had tried to settle</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>the claim, but that Hyatt was unwilling to acknowledge her client's</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>emotional distress. The complaint alleges claims for emotional distress;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>invasion of privacy; and negligent hiring, supervision and/or training,</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>a claim that I suppose means this case could set a precedent requiring</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>hotel chains to train their employees not to wear guests' underpants.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>I'm sure that, somewhere, a consultant stands ready to advise them as to</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>just how they might do that.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>In a hopefully unrelated story, we are staying at a Hyatt (in Arizona)</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>for our partner retreat this weekend.&nbsp; So far, everything seems to be</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>fine, but I don't think everyone has been back to their rooms yet.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT size=2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another Reason Not to Wear Sagging Pants: They Won't Stop Bullets</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&lt;http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/another-reason-not-to-wear-saggin</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>g-pants-they-wont-stop-bullets.html&gt; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>A couple of weeks ago, I made fun of the city council of Dublin, Georgia</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&lt;http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/09/georgia-town-enters-fight-against</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>-sagging-pants.html&gt; , which had passed a bill banning pants that sag</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>more than three inches below the "crest of the ilium," exposing the</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>buttocks or underwear, and justified this in part because of alleged</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>evidence "that wearing sagging pants is injurious to the health of the</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>wearer as it causes an improper gait." Well, it turns out that this can</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>be injurious to the health of the wearer, but not because of its effect</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>on the gait. If the wearer is within range of Kenneth Bonds, at least,</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>said wearer may find himself with one (1) or more bullets lodged</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>somewhere below the crest of the ilium.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>Come to think of it, that might have a pretty dramatic effect on your</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>gait.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>Bonds, of Memphis, Tennessee, was arrested and charged with aggravated</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>assault</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&lt;http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/oct/04/memphis-man-shoots-tee</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>n-who-refuses-pull-saggy-pan/&gt;&nbsp; recently after he shot a 17-year-old</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>low-pants wearer in the butt.&nbsp; Reportedly, the victim and a 16-year-old</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>friend were walking near Bonds' house when Bonds began yelling at them</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>to pull their pants up. The boys ignored him, which made Bonds even</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>angrier, and they did not improve his mood by then calling him a "fat</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>ass" who needed to shut up. Unfortunately for them, the (alleged) fat</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>ass had a handgun, and he fired off several shots at the boys as they</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>ran away.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>It is possible, but not confirmed, that the boys' escape was hampered by</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>the ridiculous sagging pants they were wearing, but whether that was a</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>factor or not, one of the bullets intersected with the 17-year-old's</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>buttocks. The wound was not critical and the boy was treated and</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>released. He was subsequently able to limp into the station and pick</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>Bonds out of a lineup.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>Obviously, this could have been much more serious, and there is even</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>less justification for using violence to raise waistlines than there is</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>for trying to do it through legislation. My basic position hasn't</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>changed: "saggers" should pull their pants up, but everybody else should</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>stand down.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT size=2>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventh Circuit: Plaintiff Unhappy With Search Results Can't Sue</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>Yahoo!</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&lt;http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/plaintiff-unhappy-with-search-res</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>ults-cant-sue-yahoo-seventh-circuit-rules.html&gt; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>"Like many," this opinion begins, "Beverly Stayart was curious about</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>what she would find when she put her name into a search engine." And</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>like many, Beverly Stayart was not happy with what she found. Unlike</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>anybody else, however, Beverly Stayart sued the search engine company,</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>claiming that the results associated with her name falsely gave the</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>impression that she personally endorsed the products and services</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>listed, including various pharmaceuticals and what the Seventh Circuit</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>called websites promoting certain kinds of "escapades." On September 30,</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>the court affirmed the dismissal of Stayart's claim.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>Stayart sued under Section 43(a) of the federal Lanham Act, which</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>prohibits false advertising, false claims of endorsement, and so on. Her</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>problem was that a Lanham Act claim requires a showing that the</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>plaintiff has a "commercial interest" to protect, and Stayart did not</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>have a commercial interest in her own name.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>Stayart argued that she had indeed developed a commercial interest in</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>her name by virtue of her extensive "Internet presence," specifically</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>her "humanitarian efforts on behalf of baby seals, wolves, and wild</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>horses; what she describes as 'scholarly posts' on a website; two poems</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>that appear on a Danish website; and genealogy research." But while</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>these activities might have been "passionate and well-intentioned," the</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>court said, they were not "commercial." (Her argument also would have</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>given pretty much anybody the ability to use the Lanham Act, unless it</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>is more difficult than I think it is to get one of your poems on a</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>Danish website.)</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>She also argued that other non-profit organizations had been held to</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>have a commercial interest for purposes of the Act, but that was under a</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>different section that requires the plaintiff to have a "registered</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>mark." Since Beverly had apparently not trademarked her name (although</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>her attorney did claim at oral argument that she was the only "Beverly</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>Stayart" in the country), that didn't work, either.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>In April, Stayart sued Google</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&lt;http://www.popehat.com/2010/04/26/beverly-bev-stayart-must-think-the-wo</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>rds-serial-litigant-and-don-quixote-are-prettier-than-cialis-or-levitra/</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>&gt;&nbsp; on essentially the same grounds, and sooner or later, will get</FONT> <BR><FONT size=2>essentially the same result.</FONT> </P>
