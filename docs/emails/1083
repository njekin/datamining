Yeah, you can get in on your own. But why wouldn't you take advantage of every asset you have? First rule about law school - there is absolutely nothing fair about it. My class had academic titans that were treated like crap and people dumber than a sack of bricks treated like royalty b/c thier daddy was somebody special. 
 
You pull out all the assets and work every angle you have for lawschool and for the subsequent job search b/c it is plain and simply an unfair process - don't take any chances.

If you think you can handle it - its a pretty good degree to have. You can come work with me - we'll take the world by storm.
