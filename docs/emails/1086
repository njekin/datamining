---- THE ADVENTURES OF YOUNG KARL ROVE? NEW ROVE BIOPIC POSSIBLY
STARRING.SHIA LABEOUF? ----
by Jon Bershad
I used to think that Shia LaBeouf was making all of his career decisions
on the dreams and fantasies I had circa fifth grade. I mean, the guy got
to be in two Transformers movies and play Indiana Jones' son! Thanks to
this Los Angeles Times article, I now think he's actually basing his role
choices on the fever dreams I had back when I was horribly sick and ate
pizza right before bed. That's because, if rumors are to be believed, it
appears that LaBeouf may be contemplating a role as none other than a
young Karl Rove.

---- AMERICAN FAMILY ASSOCIATION SUGGESTS JESUS WOULD HAVE LET TENNESSEE
HOME BURN ----
by Brea Tremblay
A Tennessee fire department's decision  to let a house burn after the
homeowner failed to pay a $75 firefighting fee has inspired an intense
debate about the intersection of governmental and personal responsibility.
 Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association weighs in with a
perspective that has thus far been missing from the conversation, the
Christian perspective. What would Jesus do?  Let the mother****er burn
apparently.

---- INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT! NEW ZEALAND NEWS PRESENTER LAUGHS AT INDIAN
OFFICIAL NAMED "DIKSHIT" ----
by Brea Tremblay
In the clip below, New Zealand TV presenter and caterwauling moron Paul
Henry has a bit of a laugh over the name of  Delhi Chief Minister Sheila
Dikshit. "What's her name?  Dick- shit?" Henry howls. "And it's so
appropriate because she's Indian so it should be dick-in-shit, wouldn't
it?"

---- CONAN WASHES DESK SEXILY IN HOTT NEW TBS PROMO ----
by Rachel Sklar
Is it me? No, it's not me: Conan looks HOTT in the new and hilarious
promo for his show, also named "Conan." In this promo, Conan fires up
the Def Leppard, lathers up and sponges down all in the name of comedy,
and a very clean desk. And I have to say, the flavor of New Coco still
goes down reaaal smooooth.

---- NEW CHRISTINE O'DONNELL CAMPAIGN AD: "I DIDN'T GO TO YALE" ----
by Ray Rahman
There are a few things we know about the sometimes elusive, sometimes not
elusive Christne O'Donnell. For example, we all know that she's not a
witch. And as we found out earlier, we know she didn't attend Oxford
either, despite saying so on her LinkedIn profile. And in case there was
any confusion, O'Donnell is now confirming what everybody simply assumed:
"I didn't go to Yale." A bold new witchcraft-free strategy, one that runs
counter to Sarah Palin's sagacious advice.

---- WHORE-GATE? JERRY BROWN APOLOGIZES TO MEG WHITMAN FOR AIDE'S SEXIST
SLUR ----
by Colby Hall
There is a new twist in the already heated gubernatorial race in
California, and it centers around a "private" conversation between
Democratic candidate Jerry Brown and a unidentified staffer who referred
to his opponent Meg Whitman as a "whore." The conversation was
inadvertently caught on tape and has increased tensions in a tight and
bitter campaign.

---- NEW SHOWTIME SERIES LOOK EXPLORES WORLD OF SECURITY CAMERAS,
OVER-SHARING ----
by Steve Krakauer
With cell phone video cameras, security cameras and social media tools
like Twitter, people in America are more exposed than ever. If someone
wanted to be watching, and following, they could.

A new "very R-rated" series on Showtime, Look (premiering Sunday at
Midnight), explores this theme. We talked to creator Adam Rifkin this
week.

---- FINALLY! NEW VIDEO GAME ALLOWS SARAH PALIN VS. BARACK OBAMA...IN
BASKETBALL? ----
by Glenn Davis
EA Sports just released a new edition  of the classic NBA Jam franchise,
and fans of the iconic arcade game will be happy to see that the game's
comically exaggerated animations and player leaping abilities are alive
and well - not to mention looking better than ever, thanks to
technological advancements.

---- GRETA VAN SUSTEREN HELPED GIVE ELIOT SPITZER HIS START ON TV: ON CNN
IN 1995 ----
by Steve Krakauer
Greta Van Susteren was a guest on our return to Office Hours yesterday,
and the wide ranging conversation included Gloria Allred, Sarah Palin and
Hillary Clinton.

But Van Susteren also revealed how she helped give new CNN host Eliot
Spitzer his start on TV.

---- RICK SANCHEZ ON GMA: TAKES "FULL RESPONSIBILITY," BRINGS UP LACK OF
DIVERSITY IN PRIME TIME ----
by Steve Krakauer
Rick Sanchez appeared on ABC's Good Morning America this morning in an
interview with George Stephanopoulos - his first interview since being
fired one week ago.

While he appeared remorseful, it is clear he is still bitter about the
Daily Show ribbing and still feels there is something behind the lack of
diversity in prime time cable news.

---- IN RARE CNN INTERVIEW, CHRISTINE O'DONNELL WON'T SAY SARAH PALIN'S
QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT ----
by Tommy Christopher
Every journalist knows that when a politician tells you to "call my people
and set something up," that's usually a definite signal not to hold one's
breath. In a shocking exception to that rule, media-phobic Senate
candidate Christine O'Donnell made good on such a promise to CNN's Jim
Acosta the very next day.

O'Donnell may yet regret that decision, however, because when Acosta asked
her if Sarah Palin is qualified to be President, O'Donnell couldn't bring
herself to respond in the affirmative (cue angry email from Todd Palin).
The rest of the interview wasn't much better. (h/t TPC)

---- VILLAGE VOICE: WHITE PEOPLE IN AMERICA HAVE GONE INSANE ----
by Glynnis MacNicol
These days the Voice generally makes itself known in the media world
through its excellent blog Runnin' Scared or by way of plain old
aggregation, which is how I came across last week's cover story:  "White
America Has Lost Its Mind: The white brain, beset with worries, finally
goes haywire in spectacular fashion."  Which is sort a spectacular title,
it must be said and attempts to explain the current national mood. 
Behold.

---- RACHEL MADDOW GETS IN EPIC BATTLE WITH GOP CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE
ART ROBINSON ----
by Colby Hall
Art Robinson is the GOP candidate for Oregon's Fourth Congressional
District. Last night he bravely went on to The Rachel Maddow Show to
discuss his background and some specifics of his campaign.  Host Rachel
Maddow calmly tried to get to know Robinson by asking specific questions
about his previous writings, but was not very successful in getting past
Robinson's claims that the host was "smearing his reputation," "throwing
mud" and "sarcasm." Oddly, this style of"opiniotainment" was really fun to
watch.

---- WNYW FOX5/FOX NEWS REPORTER CHARLES LEAF ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON
A MINOR ----
by Colby Hall
A North New Jersey regional website is reporting that a reporter for WNYW
Fox5, the New York CIty's Fox News affiliate, is being held on $250,000
bail after being arrested for aggravated sexual assault on a minor. The
reporter has been identified as Charles Leaf, who received some national
attention for an attempted ambush interview with Sharif el-Gamal, the
developer behind the so-called "Ground Zero Mosque," back in late August
of this year.

---- LOU DOBBS AND THE NATION REPORTER CLASH OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT
CONTROVERSY ON THE LAST WORD ----
by Glenn Davis
Lawrence O'Donnell continued his booking hot streak tonight when he had
both Lou Dobbs - at the center of this controversy about employing illegal
immigrants on his property - and Isabel MacDonald (whose report in The
Nation sparked the controversy) on his program to debate the issue of
whether Dobbs once employed illegal immigrants, despite his long-standing
hard-line stance against illegal immigration.

---- RICK SANCHEZ CONDUCTING FIRST POST-FIRING INTERVIEW ON GOOD MORNING
AMERICA TOMORROW ----
by Glenn Davis
Newly-unemployed Rick Sanchez will grant his first interview since he was
fired last week tomorrow, and - surprise! - Keith Olbermann's not getting
it. Rather, he's heading over to ABC, where Robin Roberts and George
Stephanopoulos bring Sanchez onto Good Morning America.

---- BILL O'REILLY ON FOX NEWS' 14TH BIRTHDAY: "OUR CABLE NEWS COMPETITION
HAS BEEN DESTROYED" ----
by Glenn Davis
Today is the 14th anniversary of Fox News' launch, and Bill O'Reilly
marked the occasion on the Factor tonight by playing an old clip of what
was then the The O'Reilly Report - and taking some shots at the network's
competition (or lack thereof).

---- PARKER SPITZER NEARLY DOUBLES LEAD-IN JOHN KING, USA; STILL FINISHES
4TH ----
by Steve Krakauer
. Parker Spitzer was basically flat in the A25-54 demographic and down
slightly in total viewers, but because of the low ratings of John King,
USA, PS nearly doubled its lead-in in the demo (62,000 to 123,000). Parker
Spitzer remained in 4th place at 8pmET in both categories.

---- SEMI-INTERESTING MEDIA WAR A BREWIN'?: LETTERMAN VS. HANNITY! ----
by Jon Bershad
Ah, this could be fun. Last night, David Letterman used the Fox & Friends
jetpack gaffe as a springboard for a Top 10 list of "Signs There's Trouble
at FOX News." While the segment's barbs never got any more critical that
insinuating that Bill O'Reilly was going to institute a "No Pants Zone,"
NewsBusters picked the story up and now Sean Hannity is going to run with
it. Set your DVRs for "mildly amused!"

---- BASEBALL GREAT'S WIFE SAYS HE EXPOSED HER TO HIV ----
by Glenn Davis
Maria Del "Maripily" Pilar Rivera Alomar, wife of Roberto Alomar, is

sex with her even though she says he knows he is HIV positive, a New York
Post piece reported early this morning.

---- FOX NEWS CELEBRATES ITS 14TH BIRTHDAY; TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WELL
THEY'VE AGED! ----
by Hillary Busis
14 years ago today, Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes launched the Fox News
Channel-a network that has now been the top cable news network since
2002, when it overtook CNN. And though there have been a lot of comings
and goings throughout the years-who else is pumped to see some chimps
hosting Fox & Friends?-a select few have been with Fox since the very
beginning. Check out our slide show of then and now pictures, and please,
feel free to play this song in the background while you do.

---- SARAH PALIN URGES CHRISTINE O'DONNELL TO RUN WITH THAT WITCHCRAFT
HOOK ----
by Tommy Christopher
Democrats everywhere should be begging Christine O'Donnell (R-De) to
follow Sarah Palin's advice. On Fox News' Hannity, the former Alaska
Governor (and possible 2012 Presidential candidate?) told host Sean
Hannity that O'Donnell should "explain what the real witchcraft and voodoo
politics and economics is and that's what's going on in DC," referencing
O'Donnell's now-infamous "I am not a witch" ad.

---- GRETA VAN SUSTEREN VS. GLORIA ALLRED: ROUND TWO ----
by Hillary Busis
Last weekend, lawyer Gloria Allred was ripped to shreds when she appeared
on Greta Van Susteren's show to discuss former housekeeper Nicky Diaz
Santillan's lawsuit against California gubernatorial candidate Meg
Whitman. But even though Van Susteren called her "delusional" and accused
her of blackmailing the former eBay CEO, Allred elected to appear "On The
Record" again yesterday.

---- CHRISTINE O'DONNELL CLAIMS TO BE A VICTIM OF THE MEDIA'S "CHARACTER
ASSASSINATION" ----
by Ray Rahman
Christine O'Donnell's pledge to avoid national media attention continues
to be broken, oftentimes against her will. Rachel Maddow is publicly and
unsuccessfully stalking her, while David Axelrod and David Letterman are
joking about her magical abilities. And last night CNN gained footage of
the aspiring senator speaking at a "tightly controlled" Republican forum
in Delaware, where she ignored the news cameras and told her that she's a
victim of "character assassination."

---- THIRD HOUR OF TODAY TOPPED LIVE WITH REGIS & KELLY FOR FIRST TIME
LAST SEASON ----
by Jon Bershad
For the first time since the morning program was lengthened in 2000, the
third hour of Today beat out Live With Regis & Kelly in the ratings during
the 2009-2010 season. For those keeping track, that's the hour of Today
that's anchored by Al Roker, Ann Curry and Natalie Morales. Clearly
someone's going to have to get Regis to start dancing around grocery
stores more often.

---- JOHN STOSSEL ILLUSTRATES NATIONAL DEBT WOES BY LITERALLY TAKING TOYS
FROM BABIES ----
by Colby Hall
There may never be a more apt example of the infantilization of cable news
than the following clip of John Stossel literally taking toy's away from
babies to demonstrate the national debt. One can only guess why Stossel
and his producers thought this to be an effective shtick, but we guess its
mostly because he thinks his viewers are idiots. That probably also
explains what many see has his exceptionally smug demeanor as well.

Today they have a breaking report about the hosts of the show being
replaced by chimps.

---- FOX BUSINESS' ERIC BOLLING AND GUESTS RIDICULE PARKER SPITZER DEBUT
----
by Colby Hall
If you haven't  heard about CNN's new 8pm show Parker Spitzer, its
probably because you haven't been paying much attention to, well Mediaite,
nor a host of other media outlets who seem somewhat fascinated by many
story lines attached to the new show. And after the less than impressive
debut ratings came out, there has been a fair amount of schadenfreude
directed towards host Eliot Spitzer and CNN in general. Take for example,
FBN's Eric Bolling.

---- THE WHOLE STORY ABOUT OBAMA MTV TOWN HALL 'CASTING CALL' AND
REPUBLICAN 'HICK' AD ----
by Tommy Christopher
National Review Online has discovered a "casting call" for an MTV town
hall event scheduled for October 14, the implication being that this is
evidence of artifice in the makeup of the audience. The notice seems to
suggest that the audience for the joint MTV/BET/CMT event will be composed
of actors, eliciting predictable outrage on the right. In reality, the
same submission request was included in the event's press release,
invitations to colleges, and on the network websites.

---- FNC'S AILES APPRENTICE PROGRAM ABOUT TO GRADUATE SIXTH CLASS ----
by Ray Rahman
Congratulations are in order to a group of people who have "graduated"
from Fox News - the sixth graduating class of FNC's Apprentice Program,
recently renamed the Roger Ailes Apprentice Program will be honored for
their service on Oct. 12.  The program began in 2003 as a way of providing
"minorities at entry-level positions with an opportunity to gain valuable
behind-the-scenes experience working at a cable network that otherwise
wouldn't be available to them."
