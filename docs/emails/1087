   Well, it's finally come to an end. After several terrible months, Bravo's
   great, great shame has lurched across the finish line and, predictably,
   nothing was resolved, explained, answered, etc. Everyone just keeps being
   awful and there is no justice.

   So this was the episode with the big White House State Dinner crash. You
   know, that old story about two clinically insane mummies who came crashing
   through the windows of America's national palace and took a series of
   sexually provocative photos with Big Fuckin' Joe Biden. What a tale! What a
   yarn! Two chemically imbalanced Frankenstein monsters did not follow the
   social code of human beings one night and everyone was shocked. Folks. Are
   you shocked when zombies try to eat your brains instead of politely sitting
   down for tea? Do your monocles fall out in civilized horror when banshees
   howl so loud your skin falls off instead of joining you in courtly dancing?
   Ghouls, wraiths, Cthulhus, harridans, and any other sort of hell-creature
   similar to the Salahis just do not understand our societal mores. It's just
   not in their monster DNA. So we really shouldn't be so surprised that the
   Salahis behaved the way they did.

   But we can be angry! We can be angry because they are just so fitfully
   annoying. Ohhh they are so annoying. They are so annoying because their
   particular brand of crazy puts them at the center of some great tale of
   intrigue and power and status and class. They are the brave, beautiful
   couple lowering their heads as they pass, gloriously and elegantly clothed,
   through a throng of cameras and questions. "Mr. & Mrs. Salahi! Why are you
   so interesting?" "Mr. & Mrs. Salahi! What does it feel like to be American
   royalty?" I think these are the questions they are actually hearing in the
   horrifying, dimly lit, black helium balloon-filled recesses of their minds.
   They think they are very important, very interesting people. So important
   and interesting that when they got written about in the WaPo gossip column
   about crashing the State Dinner, Tareq just shook that gray gnocchi lump of
   a head and said "This is just what they do." Yes, what they do. To people
   like you. To people in your scrutinized position. Oh how grand, then, it
   would have been to see their faces as the first of the national news
   broadcasts came on and mentioned them, and then another one, and another
   one, and another one, until it was everywhere. Do you think we could have
   seen a moment there when it changed for Tareq & Michaele from fun little
   center-of-attention moment to impossibly unwieldy national embarrassment? I
   hope we could have. I hope that somewhere deep down they were terrified by
   what they'd actually done.

   But of course we didn't see that. We only saw them all giddy and nervous and
   weird in the limo on the way to the party, saying "There are many more State
   Dinners to come." We saw someone at the gate stare hard at a clipboard and
   say "Uh... you're not on here..." But obviously since there were TV cameras
   and the two shaved macaques were all dressed up, the gate attendant let them
   in. And then there was the last we saw of them that evening, the crooked
   pair strolling down a darkened pathway, the eerie white glow of a city night
   filling the sky around them, the air trembling with an ill sort of
   wrongness. It was actually genuinely a little creepy! Good work, Bravo
   camera crew. Good work indeed.

   And then the next day they were looking through their pictures
   ("Katieeee..." Michaele said, showing Tareq a picture of her and Katie
   Couric, as if they were bestest old friends. "You know, just Katieee.") and
   Tareq was leafing through the newspaper and there it was. And there it went.
   Everyone found out. Stacy and her gossip-hen wife Rudiger got their
   turtleneck sweaters in a bunch and just could not stop talking about it.
   Just could not stop! They were so embarrassed to be associated with this
   thing that they just could not stop talking about! They called everyone they
   knew. They called Cat, they called Linda the Sleepytime Snore Monster from
   Boringsville, they called Mary Mary Face Contrary, they called grandmoms and
   aunties and uncles, they called pastors and milkmen and swamis, they called
   governors and judges and cats that live in pigeon-filled back alleys, they
   called actors and cellists and street mimes, they called each other, they
   called themselves, they called the toaster, they called an ant they'd killed
   in the kitchen three summers ago, they called God in heaven, they called the
   Devil Falwell below. They called everyone they could possibly call, because
   they in no way want to be associated with this embarrassment. Good work
   guys!

   No one said anything new or interesting. "They're crazy!" "They're plastic!"
   (Cat's favorite insult, which was accurate, but didn't hit closely enough,
   honestly. Yes, they're fake, but that's not the main problem with them.
   Their delusion is the worst thing about them.) "They're nuts!" "They're
   disrespecting Washington!" Ha. That one was rich. Oh _are_ they now, ladies?
   Are _they_ disrespecting Washington while you, what, graciously respect
   Washington by parading around town with your camera crews, name dropping
   'til your false teeth fall out, claiming to be movers and shakers while the
   real movers and shakers - whether they themselves are witless lobby shits or
   actual get-stuff-done'ers - shake (and move!) their heads in sad dismay?
   Yeah, no, you're right, ladies. It's the Salahis and the Salahis alone who
   are disrespecting Washington. Mm hm.

   All of this crow-cawing was pretty much useless. Tareq and Michaele refused
   to answer questions at their little C-Span party, and then they refused to
   answer questions at Stacey and Rudiger's backbiting Get The Dirt party, and
   it was just so dumb. "We've been advised not to talk about that," they said,
   as if there were _ssssecrets_ that they couldn't tell, as if they were privy
   to some classified information, rather than the truth. "No, we've been
   advised not to talk about that lest we be forced to say that we, grown
   adults, sneaked into a party and are now scared of getting trouble." Fuh! I
   say to them. Fuh fuh fuh. And the rest? Blech. Stacey and Rudiger were
   embarrassing two-facers, Cat yelled as she always yells, Linda did
   zzzzzZZzzzz, and Mary... oh who the hell knows. No one cares. Does anyone
   care at this point, about any of this? It's a lovely Friday and this show is
   finally over and we should all be focusing on more important things.

   At the end of the episode we got the traditional season wrap-up updates,
   only this time there was absolutely nothing interesting. Because no one
   cares about any of these people or their "plot lines"! No one cares. You
   might find one person, somewhere, someone who lives in the woods maybe and
   only has a little rabbit ears antenna on their old black and white TV that
   only picks up reception once a week, and it only picks up Bravo, so their
   only connection to the outside world is these women. That person might care
   that Linda is done decorating her house and has given keys to Ebong and she
   will zzzzZzzzzLunestaZzzzzzzz. They might care that Mary wandered outside
   late one night, drunk as canaries, and dug up a new face in the backyard.
   They might care that Cat has been seen wandering around town swilling from a
   bottle of Beefeater, flicking cigarettes at passersby. They might care that
   Stacey and Rudiger have started printing a little gossip newspaper from
   their family computer, giggling and turtlenecking about all the bad things
   they want NOTHING to do with.

   And yes, the person in the woods, the Watcher in the Woods, might care that
   Michaele and Tareq are still stalking the streets of D.C., and still roam
   the eerie, mist-strewn hills of the imaginary Virginia Wine Country. They
   might care that there is still a light on in a window on the third floor of
   the old Salahi place, that there is the silhouette of an old woman in the
   window that never moves. They might care that one morning while brushing her
   teeth, Michaele coughed and a bat flew out of her mouth. They might care
   that Tareq has been spending more and more time in the dank, dark basement,
   doing god only knows what, an occasional strangled whimper or moan piercing
   the chilly quiet. They might care that the vineyard has, all of a sudden,
   become overgrown with a strange and foreign kind of moss, covering the thick
   layers of peat, burying any future hopes for vines and grapes. They might
   care that local horticulturists and botanists cannot figure out just what
   kind of moss it is, or where it came from, or why they feel so inexplicably
   sad and alone whenever they are near it. The person alone in the woods might
   care that the moss has grown all the way up to the house, on the porch even,
   creeping in the front door. Or is it creeping out of it? Could all of Tareq
   & Michaele's thick, boggy lies be producing something, could they have given
   birth to a brand new plague? The person in the woods might concern
   themselves with these eerie facts, these mysterious questions.

   But us? No, not us. We don't care. We're moving on. The midterms are coming
   and that means change. It means things are moving on, for better or worse.
   It means that we should only look forward and that we should (and have
   already, I hope) forget these women and these men and these mother-corpses
   and these glitzy, stolen parties. You know, they say that when Washington
   burned in 1814, you could see the smoke all the way from the Patuxent River.
   But now, two hundred years later, we can see the wispy evidence of these new
   fires from much farther off, can't we? From whole different cities, from
   miles and miles away. And the smoke, well, it almost looks like souls or
   ghosts, doesn't it? Rising up out of the flame and ash, trying to fleet
   toward heaven.

   But, heavy as these restless, angry spirits are - laden with cameras and
   wigs and plastic appendages - I just don't think they'll ever get there.
