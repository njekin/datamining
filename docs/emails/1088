1.    Illiterate Clown Elected to Congress
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/illiterate-clown-elected-to-congr
ess.html> 

In a development that must be raising the spirits of many American
candidates, an inexperienced, illiterate clown has won a landslide
victory <http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39495001/ns/world_news-americas/>
in Brazil's congressional elections.

 
<http://kevinunderhill.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451bd4469e2013487f6add9970c
-popup> Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva, whose clown name is Tiririca
("Grumpy"), got more than 1.3 million votes, more than twice the number
of votes received by his next closest competitor. How did he do it? With
complete honesty.

"What does a congressman do?" Grumpy said in campaign ads. "The truth is
I don't know. But vote for me and I'll [find out and] tell you." He
promised, in fact, to do nothing during his term other than finding out
what they do in Congress and telling the voters about it, and voters
seemed to think that was a great idea. Or they may have been swayed by
Grumpy's slogan: "It can't get any worse!"

They certainly did not care that someone probably came up with this
slogan for him, or at least wrote it down for him. Grumpy (shown to the
right celebrating the complete breakdown of Brazilian political culture)
survived a last-minute try by public prosecutors to disqualify him on
the grounds of illiteracy, and as noted went on to a landslide victory.

This will very likely turn out to be a boon for other candidates as
well, at least those in Grumpy's coalition. Under Brazilian law, a
candidate's "excess votes" can apparently be passed on to other
affiliated candidates, so they will have approximately 650,000 reasons
to be glad they had an illiterate clown on the ticket.

2.    Legal Drama Finally Pleads Guilty to Sucking
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/outlaw-finally-pleads-guilty-to-s
ucking.html> 

Entertainment Weekly reports
<http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/10/06/nbc-drama-outlaw-goes-on-prod
uction-hiatus/>  that NBC has halted production on Outlaw, its new legal
drama starring Jimmy Smits as a conservative but hard-partying Supreme
Court justice with a gambling problem who resigns from the Court to go
into private practice as a liberal defense attorney.

Yet another legal show with plots "ripped from the headlines."

Let's see if the reviews can provide some sort of clue as to why
production of Outlaw has been stopped after just three episodes. The
show has been described as:

*	"overblown" (NYT) 
*	"idiotic" (NY Post) 
*	"jaw-droppingly simple-minded" (Variety) 
*	a "near-parody of [other] law shows" (EW) 
*	possibly "the most preposterous show of the fall" (Boston
Herald) 
*	"either cynical manipulation or just plain silly" (LA Times) 
*	"so ludicrously dumb that your eyeballs will hurt from rolling
so much" (Wash. Post) 
*	"the biggest lawyer joke of all" (Miami Herald) 
*	a "piece of sh*t" (Above the Law) 
*	and -- the only one of the many law-related puns that was any
good -- "guilty by reason of inanity" (TV Guide). 

The show is not quite dead - the network apparently has five episodes
already in the can, so if America suddenly falls in love with Outlaw,
production could still resume. Although at this point, that seems about
as likely as the show's premise.

3.    Hotel Sued After Employee Caught Wearing Guest's Underwear
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/hotel-sued-after-employee-caught-
wearing-guests-underwear.html> 

Opinions vary about how much you should tip hotel employees, but in this
situation, there is general agreement that it should be zero dollars.

A Los Angeles woman is suing the Hyatt hotel chain, alleging that she
returned to her room at a Hyatt in Deerfield, Illinois, to find a male
Hyatt employee wearing some of her clothes. According to the report
<http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2010/10/hotel-guest-claims-male-empl
oyee-wore-her-underwear.html> , Dayanara Fernandez alleges that the man
was wearing a Hyatt shirt along with one of her skirts and a pair of her
high heels, and, most creepily, her underwear. "After changing his
clothes," the report continues, the man handed her various items of
clothing, including several pairs of her underwear," which she
presumably burned immediately.

Fernandez called the front desk (and that's a conversation I would like
to have heard), and they called police. The report cites Lake County
court records showing that the man later pleaded guilty to a disorderly
conduct charge and was fined $187.

Fernandez's attorney was quoted as saying that she had tried to settle
the claim, but that Hyatt was unwilling to acknowledge her client's
emotional distress. The complaint alleges claims for emotional distress;
invasion of privacy; and negligent hiring, supervision and/or training,
a claim that I suppose means this case could set a precedent requiring
hotel chains to train their employees not to wear guests' underpants.

I'm sure that, somewhere, a consultant stands ready to advise them as to
just how they might do that.

 

In a hopefully unrelated story, we are staying at a Hyatt (in Arizona)
for our partner retreat this weekend.  So far, everything seems to be
fine, but I don't think everyone has been back to their rooms yet.

4.    Another Reason Not to Wear Sagging Pants: They Won't Stop Bullets
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/another-reason-not-to-wear-saggin
g-pants-they-wont-stop-bullets.html> 

A couple of weeks ago, I made fun of the city council of Dublin, Georgia
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/09/georgia-town-enters-fight-against
-sagging-pants.html> , which had passed a bill banning pants that sag
more than three inches below the "crest of the ilium," exposing the
buttocks or underwear, and justified this in part because of alleged
evidence "that wearing sagging pants is injurious to the health of the
wearer as it causes an improper gait." Well, it turns out that this can
be injurious to the health of the wearer, but not because of its effect
on the gait. If the wearer is within range of Kenneth Bonds, at least,
said wearer may find himself with one (1) or more bullets lodged
somewhere below the crest of the ilium.

Come to think of it, that might have a pretty dramatic effect on your
gait.

Bonds, of Memphis, Tennessee, was arrested and charged with aggravated
assault
<http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/oct/04/memphis-man-shoots-tee
n-who-refuses-pull-saggy-pan/>  recently after he shot a 17-year-old
low-pants wearer in the butt.  Reportedly, the victim and a 16-year-old
friend were walking near Bonds' house when Bonds began yelling at them
to pull their pants up. The boys ignored him, which made Bonds even
angrier, and they did not improve his mood by then calling him a "fat
ass" who needed to shut up. Unfortunately for them, the (alleged) fat
ass had a handgun, and he fired off several shots at the boys as they
ran away.

It is possible, but not confirmed, that the boys' escape was hampered by
the ridiculous sagging pants they were wearing, but whether that was a
factor or not, one of the bullets intersected with the 17-year-old's
buttocks. The wound was not critical and the boy was treated and
released. He was subsequently able to limp into the station and pick
Bonds out of a lineup.

Obviously, this could have been much more serious, and there is even
less justification for using violence to raise waistlines than there is
for trying to do it through legislation. My basic position hasn't
changed: "saggers" should pull their pants up, but everybody else should
stand down.

5.    Pirate Loose in Law Firm
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/pirate-loose-in-law-firm.html> 

Or at least that's what I infer from this email, forwarded to me this
week from a Midwestern law firm [not mine] by one who wishes to remain
anonymous:

Subject: Found - Skull & Crossbones Eye Patch
 
I found a skull & crossbones eye patch on this floor.  It's at my desk
if anyone wants to claim it.

Halloween is almost a month away, and Litigate Like a Pirate Day has
already passed, but I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation
for this.

6.    Seventh Circuit: Plaintiff Unhappy With Search Results Can't Sue
Yahoo!
<http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/plaintiff-unhappy-with-search-res
ults-cant-sue-yahoo-seventh-circuit-rules.html> 

"Like many," this opinion begins, "Beverly Stayart was curious about
what she would find when she put her name into a search engine." And
like many, Beverly Stayart was not happy with what she found. Unlike
anybody else, however, Beverly Stayart sued the search engine company,
claiming that the results associated with her name falsely gave the
impression that she personally endorsed the products and services
listed, including various pharmaceuticals and what the Seventh Circuit
called websites promoting certain kinds of "escapades." On September 30,
the court affirmed the dismissal of Stayart's claim.

Stayart sued under Section 43(a) of the federal Lanham Act, which
prohibits false advertising, false claims of endorsement, and so on. Her
problem was that a Lanham Act claim requires a showing that the
plaintiff has a "commercial interest" to protect, and Stayart did not
have a commercial interest in her own name.

Stayart argued that she had indeed developed a commercial interest in
her name by virtue of her extensive "Internet presence," specifically
her "humanitarian efforts on behalf of baby seals, wolves, and wild
horses; what she describes as 'scholarly posts' on a website; two poems
that appear on a Danish website; and genealogy research." But while
these activities might have been "passionate and well-intentioned," the
court said, they were not "commercial." (Her argument also would have
given pretty much anybody the ability to use the Lanham Act, unless it
is more difficult than I think it is to get one of your poems on a
Danish website.)

She also argued that other non-profit organizations had been held to
have a commercial interest for purposes of the Act, but that was under a
different section that requires the plaintiff to have a "registered
mark." Since Beverly had apparently not trademarked her name (although
her attorney did claim at oral argument that she was the only "Beverly
Stayart" in the country), that didn't work, either.

In April, Stayart sued Google
<http://www.popehat.com/2010/04/26/beverly-bev-stayart-must-think-the-wo
rds-serial-litigant-and-don-quixote-are-prettier-than-cialis-or-levitra/
>  on essentially the same grounds, and sooner or later, will get
essentially the same result.
