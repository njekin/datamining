By the way, I don't even know if I mentioned it to you, but I have Fall Break on Thursday and Friday. I'm going to do lots of work (at least I hope to), but I'll also have some free time to see you!

Are we still on for tomorrow? I'm all set to make my deadlines and be able to relax all afternoon with you before you head out of town.
