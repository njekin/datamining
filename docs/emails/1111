Yes there is. It's called migrating from tmail.

[1]How To Keep the New Facebook From Flooding Your Inbox With Spam

   Facebook's new groups [2]can help enhance your privacy, but they're also a 
   ridiculously easy way to spam other users on the social network. It's only a 
   matter of time before the bad guys figure this out and start wrecking 
   inboxes.

   It's already begun happening to some power users. Longtime blogger Anil Dash 
   wrote, " I wanted to like groups, but [3]now I'm on 50 unwanted email lists. 
   More incompetent defaults, or an attempt to undermine email?" Social media 
   writer Laura Fitton asked, "Did Facebook simply 'forget' 15 years of email 
   list best practices? I.e., [4]email lists should be opt in, not opt out?" 
   And branding executive Walter Elly quipped, "Facebook? More like 
   [5]automaticallyoptyouINBOOK." Zing!

   The problem, in a nutshell, is that Facebook's new groups automatically 
   email members about new postings. And you can be added to a group by any 
   "friend," without permission. When you combine the policy of non-consensual 
   group formation with the policy of sending everyone email notifications by 
   default, you get a spam machine, which is what Facebook will soon become if 
   the company does not take steps to fix this situation. (We've not been able 
   to [6]get comment from the company on whether that's in the cards.)

   Web entrepreneur Jason Calacanis thinks Facebook has screwed up the details 
   of groups so badly that it will soon face privacy lawsuits. After someone 
   enrolled Calacanis in a group that implied he was a pedophile, as a baseless 
   prank, he emailed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to call the groups interface 
   "[7]troubling."

   Luckily, there is a way for savvy users to avoid the group spam problem. Go 
   to your Facebook page, then select the "Account" menu in the upper right 
   corner, and go to "Account settings:" 

   On the "My Account" page, you'll see a variety of tabs on top. Select 
   "Notifications:" 

   On the [8]"notifications" settings page, scroll down to the "Groups" 
   section. It's after the "Facebook" section and "Photos" section. You'll 
   probably want to uncheck the last three types of notifications, at least, to 
   avoid the most common types of group emails:

   You should probably retain the first notification checkbox, "adds you to a 
   group," if you want to be able to quickly un-join unsavory groups your 
   "friends" might sign you up for. 

   Happy [9]clique joining!
