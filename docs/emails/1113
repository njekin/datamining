That looks a lot like an empty threat. Good luck with that. They are so desperate right now.

Here is what she sent and what I told her back. No worries - she's just trying to play hardball. We'll let them stew in the idea of another company buying the business out and see how willing they are to ante up then.

Regardless of whether "pickle is sassy sentiments" . . . Boone is a 50% partner. If you don't want to come in line with a better offer, then we'll have to start calling other card companies and taking offers from them. The partnership agreement provides that the business is to be sold - it doesn't have to be sold to pickle. Tell your client (which is supposed to be the partnership - although it is quite clear you have skirted your fiducairy duty and decided to just represent pickle) that if she doesn't want to pay more for "her" business, she can open up a different card shop and try to compete with whichever company buys Sassy Sentiments. 
 
If you don't think another company will pay what we're asking, feel free to take that chance, but remind pickle that if she doesn't ante up - Sassy Sentiments will no longer be hers at all. 
 
Our former offer still stands

Mr. Radley, 

We cannot accept that offer.  Pickle and I believe that $40,700 for Boone's part of the partnership is more than reasonable based on the rationale I stated in previous emails to you and your client.  We are not lowballing you.  Pickle is Sassy Sentiments, and she can easily start up a new greeting card company if you don't want to go through with this.

You're still lowballing us. Don't you have a fiducairy duty as the partnership lawyer to both Pickle and my client? It seems you forgot about you duty to him and are just interested in getting the best deal you can for Pickle. 


With that in the back of your mind, consider carefully our revised offer: 
  
You say the business makes my client $12,600 a year yet his records show it makes him $18,000. We'll meet in the middle at $15,000 (actually $15,300 is the middle so I'm being generous). Again, we refuse to budge on demanding three years future earnings - if you want 3 years non-compete, then you will give us three years of future earnings. Keep in mind also that we are agreeing to pay half of your fee even though you've done all of jack squat for my client (except urge him to take deals you knew were below what he could get). If you want us to budge more than the figures below, the non-compete and the provision requring us to pay half of your fee must also change. Finally, int the interest of wrapping things up, we will agree to the figure you presented for goodwill of $62,500 even though that figure is low. So the amount Mr. Radley will receive (not the full price - the amount he will actually receive) stands as: 


1) Future earnings: $15,000 x 3 = $45,000 
  
2) Goodwill: $62,500/2 = 31,250 
  
3) Half funds in the bank 
  
Total amount Mr. Radley will receive: $76,250 (plus his share of bank funds)

Mr. Radley, 

I have communicated to Ms. Harris the revised terms.  We believe that it would be grossly unfair to compensate Mr. Boone Radley for three years of projected earnings and to pay the amount you proposed in your email.    At this point, Ms. Harris is prepared to offer half of your proposed amounts so she can move forward with her life.  Here are the following counteroffers:  

1) $12,600 (using your figures) x 1.5 = $18,900 
  
2) Goodwill, name, projected increase in future earnings, and taking into account the non-compete = $62,500 
  
3) Plus whatever money is in the bank, split 50/50 

Total offer on the price of the business: $81,400.  Split evenly = $40,700 (plus 50% of the money in the bank currently).  

Please communicate these terms to your client. 

Regards, 
Gem Finch

Ms. Finch, 
  
My client, Boone Radley, has forwarded me several e-mails pertaining to terminating his partnership with Charlotte Harris with respect to Sassy Sentiments. I will be handling Mr. Radley's negotiations from now on. Please direct any inquiries or other e-mails to me and I will consult with my client as needed. 


As for the settlement agreement, my client's biggest concerns as of now are (1) the sale price of the business and (2) the non-compete agreement. Despite Charlotte's insistence on both, as attorneys we both know that these terms are in fact negotiable regardless of whether they are common or not. 


The current price is too low. Mr. Radley and Charlotte started this business as 50% partners. Mr. Radley contributed the required capital and has put two years of work into the business just like Charlotte. Whether Charlotte realizes it or not, Mr. Radley's involvement with this business was crucial to its start-up and current success. Mr. Radley should be compensated for more than 1 year of future earnings because there would be no future earnings at all if he hadn't supported this business from the start (if she could do it on her own, why did Charlotte need a partner in the first place)? 


Furthermore, the business name, Goodwill, and earning potential have been undervalued. By your numbers, the business is already bringing in over $25k annually after only two years. This figure is sure to increase in the oncoming years. People also know the name of the business and are beginning to trust the quality of the business - resulting in a significant increase in value for the soon to be sole owner, Charlotte. 


Finally, if Charlotte wants to restrict my client's ability to compete for three years, we need at least three years compensation in discounted future earnings, which is actually generous on our part given my client will be restricted from competing in six states. 


Our offer is therefore:  
  
1) $12,600 (using your figures) x 3 = $37,800 
  
2) Goodwill, name, projected increase in future earnings, and taking into account the non-compete = $125,000 
  
3) Plus whatever money is in the bank, split 50/50 
  
  
Total offer on the price of the business (not including money in the bank): $162,800 . . . split evenly between Mr. Radley and Charlotte ($81,400 each) once she has purchased the business. If she will agree to this price, we don't foresee any issues with the remaining terms. 


  
Please contact me at your convenience so we may modify and sign the agreement. 
  
  
Nathan Radley
