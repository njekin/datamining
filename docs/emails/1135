I'm so glad we got to do lunch today! It's is absolutely beautiful outside, and it was the perfect day to eat on the Square. I LOVE fall. And I love "lunching" with you :)

Are we still on for tomorrow? I'm all set to make my deadlines and be able to relax all afternoon with you before you head out of town.
