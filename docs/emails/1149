hahaha no, not at all. I went to Nashville at the last minute with my mom for the All for the Hall concert. It was AWESOME -- Keith Urban, Vince Gill, Martina McBride, Billy Currington, Miranda Lambert, Allison Kraus, Dolly Parton, John Mayer, and more, all in the same concert. It was an amazing experience. I'm glad she took me, but she didn't give me much notice!

I hope that last email didn't seem too controlling. I don't need to know where you are at all times. I just miss you and wanted to talk to you. I hope you understand. Talk to you soon. 

Boone
