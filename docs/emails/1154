I wouldn't have referred her to you unless I knew you would do a good job. I hope it works out!

That would be awesome. I'll make sure she is completely satisfied with them. I certainly don't want to make you look bad, if that's even possible.

FYI: I have a friend who might be interested in ordering some invitations from you. She has a big Christmas party every year, and I told her that she should let you do her invitations. Her name is Katie. She said she would get in touch with you.

I think I'll just let you handle this and try not to be too big of a prude with my veto power.

If you want to come to the Halloween party with me, we should come up with a good couple's costume. Got any ideas?

Subject: Blink order
 
On Friday, Blink! Urban Fashions, one of Sassy's biggest customers, called to place an order with Sassy Sentiments but I told them I couldn't place the order for them. I told them they would have to talk to Pickle. When they asked why, I just said that she is handling all new orders, but I might have also hinted that I wasn't sure she'd be able to fill them. As soon as I said it I knew I shouldn't have, but now it's really eating at me. I had to tell someone. Thanks for being there for me.  

Boone
