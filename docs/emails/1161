Anger has nothing to do with this. I'm simply not paying you for work you won't be doing. If Sassy gets more business, then that will be because of my doing, not yours. Therefore, I am not paying you for anything that might happen in the future if I am good at MY job. You have another job anyway so get off my back and sign the flipping agreement. 

Charlotte "Pickle" Harris, Owner
Sassy Sentiments

I know we both want to get this over with, but I think you should talk to your attorney. You and I both know Sassy is going nowhere but up and I don't understand why you don't think I should get my fair share for helping to put it on this trajectory. I would think your initial anger should have subsided by now.
