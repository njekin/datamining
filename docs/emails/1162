So you'll be happy with the following: 
 
1) $18k x 3 = $54k 
 
2) $62,500/2 = $31,250 
 
3) Half the money in the bank 
 
That comes out to $85,250. Our last offer was $81,000. What if we did this - let's tell her the projected figures are low, but since she thinks ours are high, we'll meet in the middle at $15,000 a year for your half btu sh will have to agree to 3 years instead of 1.5 (unless they want to change the non-compete). Then we'll say she can keep the goodwill figure where it is. That would come out to . . . 
 
1) $15k x 3 = $45k 
 
2) $62,500/2 = $31,250
 
3) Half the money in the bank 
 
Total = $76,250
 
Otherwise they're going to need to take out the non-compete or at least deaden it and they're going to need to alter the attorney's fees provision (since GEM is clearly working for Pickle). 
 
So is$76,250 a good counter offer for you right now? 
 
Let me know

In case I wasn't clear, if they're prepared to offer me 3 years at 18k plus the goodwill they've already agreed to of 62,500 plus half the money in the bank...I'll take it. But this 1.5 year business is just silly unless they want to cut the non-compete to 1.5 years. I gotta feed my family somehow and we both know the newspaper ain't doing it. I would remind them that this is not taking into consideration the future growth of Sassy which has been consistent, well-documented, and should continue barring any meltdown by Cucumbers.
