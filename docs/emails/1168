In case I wasn't clear, if they're prepared to offer me 3 years at 18k plus the goodwill they've already agreed to of 62,500 plus half the money in the bank...I'll take it. But this 1.5 year business is just silly unless they want to cut the non-compete to 1.5 years. I gotta feed my family somehow and we both know the newspaper ain't doing it. I would remind them that this is not taking into consideration the future growth of Sassy which has been consistent, well-documented, and should continue barring any meltdown by Cucumbers.
