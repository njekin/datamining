As I told you, I thought Gem's numbers were completely off. She clearly can't even add 2+2. As this spreadsheet shows, Sassy NETTED almost 36k over the last 12 months. That means 18k for me and 18k for Pickle. Where she got this 12,600 number is beyond my imagination. Anyways, that should give you something to counter with.
