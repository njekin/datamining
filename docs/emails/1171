This is hilarious considering that a few days ago they wanted to buy me out for $6800. Can you believe that? I hope you know something about legal malpractice suits because Gem is setting herself up for one.

Here's the counter-offer. Let me know what you think. I'm thinking if you can give me some figures I'll counter back with 60 or 70k. Is there a figure that you ultimately know you would be happy with (just curious so I can counter with more than that number so they'll come up to it). 
 
I told her I'd get back to her sometime tomorrow. Think about it, sleep on it, and let me know in the morning. 
 
They've come up a lot in just a few days - obviously they were trying to gig you (which, I might add, is likely a breach of Gem's fiduciary duty to you as a member of the partnership). Anyway, holler at me later.

Mr. Radley, 

I have communicated to Ms. Harris the revised terms.  We believe that it would be grossly unfair to compensate Mr. Boone Radley for three years of projected earnings and to pay the amount you proposed in your email.    At this point, Ms. Harris is prepared to offer half of your proposed amounts so she can move forward with her life.  Here are the following counteroffers:  

1) $12,600 (using your figures) x 1.5 = $18,900 
  
2) Goodwill, name, projected increase in future earnings, and taking into account the non-compete = $62,500 
  
3) Plus whatever money is in the bank, split 50/50 

Total offer on the price of the business: $81,400.  Split evenly = $40,700 (plus 50% of the money in the bank currently).  

Please communicate these terms to your client. 

Regards, 
Gem Finch

Ms. Finch, 
  
My client, Boone Radley, has forwarded me several e-mails pertaining to terminating his partnership with Charlotte Harris with respect to Sassy Sentiments. I will be handling Mr. Radley's negotiations from now on. Please direct any inquiries or other e-mails to me and I will consult with my client as needed. 


As for the settlement agreement, my client's biggest concerns as of now are (1) the sale price of the business and (2) the non-compete agreement. Despite Charlotte's insistence on both, as attorneys we both know that these terms are in fact negotiable regardless of whether they are common or not. 


The current price is too low. Mr. Radley and Charlotte started this business as 50% partners. Mr. Radley contributed the required capital and has put two years of work into the business just like Charlotte. Whether Charlotte realizes it or not, Mr. Radley's involvement with this business was crucial to its start-up and current success. Mr. Radley should be compensated for more than 1 year of future earnings because there would be no future earnings at all if he hadn't supported this business from the start (if she could do it on her own, why did Charlotte need a partner in the first place)? 


Furthermore, the business name, Goodwill, and earning potential have been undervalued. By your numbers, the business is already bringing in over $25k annually after only two years. This figure is sure to increase in the oncoming years. People also know the name of the business and are beginning to trust the quality of the business - resulting in a significant increase in value for the soon to be sole owner, Charlotte. 


Finally, if Charlotte wants to restrict my client's ability to compete for three years, we need at least three years compensation in discounted future earnings, which is actually generous on our part given my client will be restricted from competing in six states. 


Our offer is therefore:  
  
1) $12,600 (using your figures) x 3 = $37,800 
  
2) Goodwill, name, projected increase in future earnings, and taking into account the non-compete = $125,000 
  
3) Plus whatever money is in the bank, split 50/50 
  
  
Total offer on the price of the business (not including money in the bank): $162,800 . . . split evenly between Mr. Radley and Charlotte ($81,400 each) once she has purchased the business. If she will agree to this price, we don't foresee any issues with the remaining terms. 


  
Please contact me at your convenience so we may modify and sign the agreement. 
  
  
Nathan Radley
