If you have an financials, send them on in the next day or two. I'm just trying to get a read on how desperate they are right now. I'll need to use the financials if they want to play hardball back.

Do you need the financial documents or are we just playing hard ball now? The numbers don't really matter.

Ms. Finch, 

My client, Boone Radley, has forwarded me several e-mails pertaining to terminating his partnership with Charlotte Harris with respect to Sassy Sentiments. I will be handling Mr. Radley's negotiations from now on. Please direct any inquiries or other e-mails to me and I will consult with my client as needed.

As for the settlement agreement, my client's biggest concerns as of now are (1) the sale price of the business and (2) the non-compete agreement. Despite Charlotte's insistence on both, as attorneys we both know that these terms are in fact negotiable regardless of whether they are common or not.

The current price is too low. Mr. Radley and Charlotte started this business as 50% partners. Mr. Radley contributed the required capital and has put two years of work into the business just like Charlotte. Whether Charlotte realizes it or not, Mr. Radley's involvement with this business was crucial to its start-up and current success. Mr. Radley should be compensated for more than 1 year of future earnings because there would be no future earnings at all if he hadn't supported this business from the start (if she could do it on her own, why did Charlotte need a partner in the first place)?

Furthermore, the business name, Goodwill, and earning potential have been undervalued. By your numbers, the business is already bringing in over $25k annually after only two years. This figure is sure to increase in the oncoming years. People also know the name of the business and are beginning to trust the quality of the business - resulting in a significant increase in value for the soon to be sole owner, Charlotte.

Finally, if Charlotte wants to restrict my client's ability to compete for three years, we need at least three years compensation in discounted future earnings, which is actually generous on our part given my client will be restricted from competing in six states.

Our offer is therefore: 

1) $12,600 (using your figures) x 3 = $37,800 

2) Goodwill, name, projected increase in future earnings, and taking into account the non-compete = $125,000 

3) Plus whatever money is in the bank, split 50/50 


Total offer on the price of the business (not including money in the bank): $162,800 . . . split evenly between Mr. Radley and Charlotte ($81,400 each) once she has purchased the business. If she will agree to this price, we don't foresee any issues with the remaining terms.


Please contact me at your convenience so we may modify and sign the agreement. 


Nathan Radley
