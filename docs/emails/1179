Hi Boone,

My name is Katie, and I am a friend of Callie's from law school. She
mentioned that you are starting a stationary company and that you are
looking for customers. I have a Christmas party every year, and I would be
interested in seeing what types of personalized invitations you have. I'm
looking to order about 50. How much would you charge?

Thanks,
Katie
