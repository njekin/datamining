I meant to remind you on the phone earlier -- I'll be heading down to Athens this weekend to stay with my college friend. I won't be around to hang out most of the weekend, but we could probably see each other on Sunday night.

I think I'll just let you handle this and try not to be too big of a prude with my veto power.

If you want to come to the Halloween party with me, we should come up with a good couple's costume. Got any ideas?

Subject: Blink order
 
On Friday, Blink! Urban Fashions, one of Sassy's biggest customers, called to place an order with Sassy Sentiments but I told them I couldn't place the order for them. I told them they would have to talk to Pickle. When they asked why, I just said that she is handling all new orders, but I might have also hinted that I wasn't sure she'd be able to fill them. As soon as I said it I knew I shouldn't have, but now it's really eating at me. I had to tell someone. Thanks for being there for me.  

Boone
