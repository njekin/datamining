Yes, but I'm not a big costume guy.

Do any of your friends have Halloween parties?

On Friday, Blink! Urban Fashions, one of Sassy's biggest customers, called to place an order with Sassy Sentiments but I told them I couldn't place the order for them. I told them they would have to talk to Pickle. When they asked why, I just said that she is handling all new orders, but I might have also hinted that I wasn't sure she'd be able to fill them. As soon as I said it I knew I shouldn't have, but now it's really eating at me. I had to tell someone. Thanks for being there for me.  

Boone
