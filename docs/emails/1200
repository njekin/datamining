I'll bump the goodwill, name, and potential increase in earnings to $125,000 for now. We'll see how they react to this initial offer.

That all sounds good but I still think her figures are off if she gives you any trouble about the goodwill

Boone,

Let me clarify one thing (and I will clarify this to Gem as well) . . . the future profits figure I gave ($37,800) would be part Pickle's and part yours (you would get $18,900). I included the $50,000 figure as your half only for the goodwill, name, etc.

So I need to fix that in the e-mail to Gem - the second figure should be $100,000 for a total sale price of $137,800, of which you would get $68,900 plus whatever is in the bank.

So let me know if you are comfortable with $68,900 as your share of the price (not the figure I gave you in the last e-mail).

Boone,

I understand what you are saying, but I think the computation is a bit off.  First of all, Sassy makes around $2,100 (net) a month.  Your half per month would be around $1,050.  We should be using this number.  As far as the amount of time for future earnings you should get, Pickle disagrees with the five years you suggested.  She believes you should be compensated for one additional year.  So, she would be agreeable to offering $12,600 ($1,050 x 12) plus dividing equally whatever money you all have in the bank (it appears right now you have $9,233 so half of that is $4,616.50.)  So her offer to you is now $17,216.50 ($12,600 for one future year of Sassy + $4,616.50 for your half of what is in the bank). 

I advise you to take this amount.  Pickle will not agree to anywhere near compensation for five additional years.  Remember that you've only been involved for Sassy for two years.

Gem

Gem,

The uniqueness of Sassy is one of its strongest assets and one which I think you are seriously undervaluing. We are currently making between 2500 and 3500 a month in profit. Therefore, on average Sassy makes about $36000 a year. I'm not as pessimistic about the future of Sassy as you are. In fact, I think it will continue to grow and prosper. However, I am willing to let Pickle retain the earnings from all the future growth. 5 years at 36k per year equals 180k. If you add the money currently in the bank, which should of course go into the value of the company, we reach 190k. Therefore, I think 95k is a fair price for my half. That is simply the amount of money I would have made over the next five years, assuming we didn't add a single client or grow our current clients. I think those assumptions are absurd but they are in Pickle's favor and that is why I think this valuation is very conservative.

Boone

Boone,

I am listening to both you and Pickle, and I'm letting you know that Pickle wants a non-compete.  To Pickle, it is not up for negotiation.  Otherwise, why would she bother buying your portion of the partnership from you.  She needs security that you aren't going to start your own version of Sassy.  You can understand that, right? As far as the non-compete and the price of Sassy, help me understand why you think they are unreasonable.  I don't think you can support your assertions with a valid argument.

Gem,

I don't understand why you say it is non-negotiable. Everything is negotiable, unless you are taking your orders from Pickle. Besides, how am I supposed to start my own version of Sassy? Pickle comes up with all the ideas.

Boone,

I don't appreciate the tone of your last email.  I am trying to be as fair as possible.  I will run the numbers again and get some advice on a price.  I think you may need to take a hard look at what Sassy Sentiments has done too in its first two years.  I think that $200,000 is a completely absurd figure.  The company didn't even make $55,000 profit in the last two years (combined).  I know that the value of the company is worth more than just past performance and that you need to account for future growth too.  I will consult a business valuation expert and get back to you.

As far as the non-compete, this is not up for negotiation.  Otherwise what would keep you from starting your own version of Sassy Sentiments?  Anyway, why should you have to worry about it... you are a newspaper reporter.

Gem

Just because they are common does not make them necessary. As for the price, I can't even begin to describe my shock at your valuation. The company is worth no less than $200,000 and that is the most conservative number I could come up with. The fact that you think I would accept a mere 1300 over my initial capital contribution suggests that you either have no idea what you're doing, which would be almost comforting considering the alternative which is that you are actively trying to help Pickle to my detriment.

Boone,

In Tennessee, as in most states, to enforce a noncompete agreement requires that there be consideration for the agreement. Noncompetes are completely common in this sort of situation - where a Partnership such as this is breaking up.  It is normal for the noncompete to have a specific time limit and restricted to a specific geographic region.  Noncompetes are complete common in this situation.  I don't think that this is a factor that has much, if any, leeway.

As far as the valuation, I'll take a look at the numbers again and get consultation on it.  In the meantime, what do you feel is an appropriate price, and how would you justify that price?  While Sassy has shown an increase in profitability from the first year to the second, it is still a relatively new venture and its profitability as a business is somewhat uncertain in the future.

I apologize for not seeing this sooner, but I cannot sign it in its present form. The non-compete is totally unacceptable, and I think the valuation is insultingly low. Please talk to Pickle and see if there is some way to resolve these issues.

Hey Boone,

Have you read through the partnership dissolution agreement yet?  Please do so asap so we can get this going.  If you are fine with all the terms, you can sign it and send it back to me.  If you do that, I'll have Pickle sign it.  Then, I will give you both a copy of the signed agreement.

This is all good stuff - like I said, you're at the top of my list of problems to dominate tomorrow. We've got some good info here and some good leverage. I'll have it worked out before you know it.


No worries . . . stay close to your e-mail tomorrow.

This is the dissolution agreement Gem sent me to start with. As you can see from the more recent conversations, they've already nearly tripled the original offer, but I still don't think it's enough.
