Boone, 
 
Please review the figures I have included in the e-mail below. Let me know if you are not comfortable asking for only $87,600 or if you have anything you want to change before I send this to Gem. 
 
 
*******************************************************************************************************************************
 
 
Ms. Finch, 
 
My client, Boone Radley, has forwared me several e-mails pertaining to terminating his partnership with Charlotte Harris with respect to Sassy Sentiments. I will be handling Mr. Radley's negotiations from now on. Please direct any inquiries or other e-mails to me and I will consult with my client as needed. 
 
As for the settlment agreement, my client's biggest concerns as of now are (1) the sale price of the business and (2) the non-compete agreement. Despite Charlotte's insistence on both, as attorney's we both know that these terms are in fact negotiable regardless of whether they are common or not. 
 
To that end, the current price is too low. Mr. Radley and Charlotte started this business as 50% partners. Mr. Radley contributed the requried captial and has put two years of work into the business just like Charlotte. Whether Charlotte realizes it or not, Mr. Radley's invovlment with this business was crucial to its start-up and current success. Mr. Radley should be compensated for more than 1 year of future earnings because there would be no future earnings at all if he hadn't supported this business from the start (otherwise, why did Charlotte need a partner in the first place)? 
 
Furthermore, the name, Goodwill, and earning potential of the business have been undervalued. By your numbers, the business is already bringing in over $25k annually after only two years. People know the name of the business and are beginning to trust the quality of the business - resulting in a signifciant increase in value for the soon to be sole owner, Charlotte. 
 
Finally, if Charlotte wants to restrict my client's ability to compete for three years, we demand at least three years compensation in discounted future earnings, which is actually generous on our part given my client will be restricted from competing in six states. 
 
Our offer is therefore:  
 
1) $12,600 (using your figures) x 3 = $37,800
 
2) Goodwill, name, projected incease in future earnings, and taking into account non-compete = $50,000
 
3) Plus whatever money is in the bank, split 50/50
 
 
Total offer on the price (not including money in the bank): $87,800
 
 
Please contact me at your convenience so we may modify and sign the agreement. 
 
 
Nathan Radley
