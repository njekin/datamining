Sounds good. Gem just emailed me asking why I haven't responded to her. I told her to just contact you from now on.

This is all good stuff - like I said, you're at the top of my list of problems to dominate tomorrow. We've got some good info here and some good leverage. I'll have it worked out before you know it. 
 
No worries . . . stay close to your e-mail tomorrow.

This is the dissolution agreement Gem sent me to start with. As you can see from the more recent conversations, they've already nearly tripled the original offer, but I still don't think it's enough.

Hey Boone, 

Have you read through the partnership dissolution agreement yet?  Please do so asap so we can get this going.  If you are fine with all the terms, you can sign it and send it back to me.  If you do that, I'll have Pickle sign it.  Then, I will give you both a copy of the signed agreement.

Gem
