I've been thinking about your situation with Pickle and the business and the other e-mails you have sent me. Here's what we need to do . . .

1) Don't talk to Pickle or her lawyer anymore - send all e-mails from them to me and let me handle whatever they want

2) Let me try to negotiate some sort of settlement with Pickle's lawyer about how you guys are going to settle out your interest in the business

3) Try to keep your mouth shut about all of this unless you are talking to me

4) Keep me updated about everything that is going on

I'm going to start going after Pickle and her lawyer Monday. LEt me handle this and we'll have it settled before you know it. You just focus on keeping your new woman happy and let me do my job.

Good stuff. Holler at me later. I'll keep you updated on what's happening.
