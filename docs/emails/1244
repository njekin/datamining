Don't forget my undergrad degree was forestry - you aren't allowed to have a forestry degree unless you can cut things (including people) with a chainsaw ten ways

4)      Study 3 -  Seedling Source Comparison Study    

5)      Study 4 – Effect of Flooding Duration to Bottomland Oaks





Afternoon sessions 12:45 p.m. – 5:00 p.m. - Obion County – Tour TWRA hardwood plantings



1)  Three Rivers Wildlife Management Area.  760 acre tree planting.  Part of the site was planted for a TDOT Mitigation Bank.  The site was planted using TWRA tree planting methods.  Local seed collections were made, site was contour surveyed, bedded and planted on a 10 feet by 12 feet spacing.  The site was planted over a two year period, winter of 2005 and winter 2006.  We will be discussing site preparation methods, planting local seed sources, planting large diameter seedlings, matching tree species to site by elevation and survival info.



2)  Obion River WMA (Black Swamp Unit).  22 acre tree planting.  Same issues as above.  The main thing on this site is where do we go now.  What should be the next step to maintain the seedlings. 



1:00 - 2:30 Discuss Three Rivers Tree Planting (Mitigation Bank) 2:30 - 2:45 Restroom 3:00 - Depart and Head to Black Swamp Tree Planting
