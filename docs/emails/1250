I really want this one too, but I think it's too loud. Especially considering I need suits for job interviews.

Lunch was awesome and I think we made some really good contacts.

Do you know anyone from this business or ever shopped there? I tried to get Sassy in there but they said it wasn't for them, but I'm thinking this might be right up their alley. I might go talk to them 
tomorrow.
