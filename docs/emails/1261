I got you whenever you need help. I would advise you to keep the sharp replies to yourself. Just let her do the talking until she decides to shut up . . . then we'll take a look and see what we need to work out. You need not respond to her until you have something concrete to respond with. Sharp comments, while they feel good, don;t do anythign to resolve the situation (leave the sharp comments to me - I'm sure there will be plenty of them).


Let me know when it hits the fan and we'll sort it all out. Don't worry about it - the law has rules in place for these types of situations.

I didn't want to concern you with this because I know you have enough on your plate, but I'm starting to get really worried about the "partnership's attorney." She just sent me a proposed dissolution agreement that was beyond laughable. I gave her a pretty sharp reply and we'll see if she comes up with something worth responding to, but I have a feeling I'm going to need your help before this is all said and done.
