Quit being so ridiculous. We have only been in business for 2 years. Do you really think I am gonna pay you for 5 years that you aren't working?? You have another job - this is all I have Boone. I can't afford to do all of the work and only make half of the money. While you get salary from 2 jobs and only work one. 

Just be nice Boone.

Pickle,
First, just let me say again how sorry I am about this whole thing. I never wanted to hurt you. 

You say you're afraid I'm going to start a "Sassy-like" business. I don't know what that could possibly be. There can only be one Sassy because you are the creative force behind the company. Therefore, unless you plan on coming to work for me, I don't see how I could ever start a Sassy-like business. 

The uniqueness of Sassy is one of its strongest assets and one which I think you are seriously undervaluing. Of course I never said my half was worth 200k. Gem either doesn't know how to read or is deliberately trying to twist my words. We are currently making between 2500 and 3500 a month in profit. Therefore, on average Sassy makes about $36000 a year. I'm not as pessimistic about the future of Sassy as you are. In fact, I think it will continue to grow and prosper. However, I am willing to let you retain the earnings from all the future growth. 5 years at 36k per year equals 180k. If you add the money currently in the bank, which should of course go into the value of the company we reach 190k. Therefore, I think 95k is a fair price for my half. That is simply the amount of money I would have made over the next five years, assuming we didn't add a single client or grow our current clients. I think those assumptions are absurd but they are in your favor and that is why I think this valuation is very generous to you. 

Boone

Look, we both agreed that I would buy your half of Sassy Sentiments because I want to continue to run the business. I can't do that without a non-compete clause because you could just start another Sassy-like company and steal our customers. The non-complete clause IS going in the agreement. 

As for the price for your half, $200,000 is completely crazy. Sassy hasn't made that much money since it came into existence! We don't know where the business is going to go from here so there is no way we can valuate it at that price. Because I am going to have to do everything by myself now, we can only assume that the business will stay the same size for the next couple of years at least and its a real possibility that Sassy could do worse in the coming years too. I am willing to give you a little more for your half than Gem first quoted but not much more.

You really hurt me Boone. I thought we were going to be together forever. Let's just work this out so I can move on. Please.
