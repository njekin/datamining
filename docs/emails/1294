Local seed collections were made, site was contour surveyed, bedded and planted on a 10 feet by 12 feet spacing.  The site was planted over a two year period, winter of 2005 and winter 2006.  We will be discussing site preparation methods, planting local seed sources, planting large diameter seedlings, matching tree species to site by elevation and survival info.
