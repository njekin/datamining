I'm glad you think so too. I didn't want to be the one to say it but I had my reservations about them.

No problem! But the more I think about it, Cracker Barrel isn't really conducive to personalized invitations and stationery. Maybe if you do cards, you could sell them there. But it probably wouldn't be a good place for personalized products. Unless of course, it is just a monogram notecard or something.

You could also talk to Cracker Barrel. I know they carry cards, and they pick up a lot of local stuff too.

A website is something Sassy never had that I think would be a great asset to serve that purpose.

Definitely. Maybe one of the marketing themes could be that not only the designs are simple, but ordering and mailing is simple too!

That's a great idea. I don't see any reason why we can't do simple, understated holiday cards. The kind everybody wants to send, but can't afford or don't have the time, to go have a new family portrait taken every year.

Have you thought about holiday cards! They could also bring in a lot of money. If you get this business up and running soon enough, you could even start off with a bang this holiday season.

I actually anticipate that to be a central income stream for the business. I know right now the market is dominated by some big names with big selection, but since so many people are looking for something simple yet elegant, I think we can go after them.

Have you thought about incorporating wedding stationery? There's a lot of money to be made in wedding invitations, thank you notes, shower invitations, etc. I have several friends who got married this summer, and they spend a ton of money on paper products.

Please do. It's less out of the way for you than for me. Plus, it'll give me a chance to show you some of the samples I've had shipped in.

Thank you so much. I have a feeling part of the partnership split is going to be a provision that I can't go after any of our old clients, so I'm going to have to find all new ones.

one more simple design: http://www.thestationerystudio.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/catalog.viewProduct/productID/7365/catId/1086/Sailing_In_Invitations.html

I really like where you are going with this. I'll see if I can think of anyone who might be willing to buy from you on a regular basis.

Here's a real simple birth announcement:

Are these examples along the same lines of what you were thinking?

I would like to start a company called Simply Stated. It will be less edgy than Sassy. It will be more focused on personalized invitations, baby announcements, etc. The cards will not include art or graphics  just simply stated messages. What do you think? I could sure use your help.
