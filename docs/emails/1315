Well once we get to look at a final version, we'll talk it over.

I don't know if there's anyway around it. I'm trying but I'm not too confident of success. I can understand why she wants one. When we get the final version I'll definitely send it to you.

Oh no! I hate to hear that. I've never had to sign one. I'd love to look it over for you, if you want me to.

I just got the dissolution agreement from Sassy's lawyer and I am fuming. For starters, it includes a non-compete clause. I guess I should have seen this coming, but I am still concerned. Have you ever had to sign one when changing agencies or is that not done in the real estate business?
