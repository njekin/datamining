Look, we both agreed that I would buy your half of Sassy Sentiments because I want to continue to run the business. I can't do that without a non-compete clause because you could just start another Sassy-like company and steal our customers. The non-complete clause IS going in the agreement. 

As for the price for your half, $200,000 is completely crazy. Sassy hasn't made that much money since it came into existence! We don't know where the business is going to go from here so there is no way we can valuate it at that price. Because I am going to have to do everything by myself now, we can only assume that the business will stay the same size for the next couple of years at least and its a real possibility that Sassy could do worse in the coming years too. I am willing to give you a little more for your half than Gem first quoted but not much more.

You really hurt me Boone. I thought we were going to be together forever. Let's just work this out so I can move on. Please. 

Charlotte "Pickle" Harris, Owner
Sassy Sentiments
