Another one of my favorites is If It's Paper. They are located in Bearden also. They carry all kinds of paper products, party supplies, etc. You really ought to stop by there.

A website is something Sassy never had that I think would be a great asset to serve that purpose.

Definitely. Maybe one of the marketing themes could be that not only the designs are simple, but ordering and mailing is simple too!

That's a great idea. I don't see any reason why we can't do simple, understated holiday cards. The kind everybody wants to send, but can't afford or don't have the time, to go have a new family portrait taken every year.

Have you thought about holiday cards! They could also bring in a lot of money. If you get this business up and running soon enough, you could even start off with a bang this holiday season.

I actually anticipate that to be a central income stream for the business. I know right now the market is dominated by some big names with big selection, but since so many people are looking for something simple yet elegant, I think we can go after them.

Have you thought about incorporating wedding stationery? There's a lot of money to be made in wedding invitations, thank you notes, shower invitations, etc. I have several friends who got married this summer, and they spend a ton of money on paper products.

Please do. It's less out of the way for you than for me. Plus, it'll give me a chance to show you some of the samples I've had shipped in.

Thank you so much. I have a feeling part of the partnership split is going to be a provision that I can't go after any of our old clients, so I'm going to have to find all new ones.

one more simple design: http://www.thestationerystudio.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/catalog.viewProduct/productID/7365/catId/1086/Sailing_In_Invitations.html

I really like where you are going with this. I'll see if I can think of anyone who might be willing to buy from you on a regular basis.

Here's a real simple birth announcement:

Are these examples along the same lines of what you were thinking?

I would like to start a company called Simply Stated. It will be less edgy than Sassy. It will be more focused on personalized invitations, baby announcements, etc. The cards will not include art or graphics  just simply stated messages. What do you think? I could sure use your help.
