I can't thank you enough for all your help with the card ideas. I'm getting ready to ramp things up and will put to use your client suggestions as well. But enough business already, when are we going to hang out this week?

Boone

I'm sure you've seen this website before, but you ought to look at http://www.someecards.com/. Their e-cards (and now paper cards I think) are all very simple designs. They all look alike also, having a common theme. You could do something like that.

Do you know anyone from this business or ever shopped there? I tried to get Sassy in there but they said it wasn't for them, but I'm thinking this might be right up their alley. I might go talk to them 
tomorrow.
