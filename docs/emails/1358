I didn't want to concern you with this because I know you have enough on your plate, but I'm starting to get really worried about the "partnership's attorney." She just sent me a proposed dissolution agreement that was beyond laughable. I gave her a pretty sharp reply and we'll see if she comes up with something worth responding to, but I have a feeling I'm going to need your help before this is all said and done.
