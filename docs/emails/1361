Boone,

In Tennessee, as in most states, to enforce a noncompete agreement requires that there be consideration for the agreement. Noncompetes are completely common in this sort of situation - where a Partnership such as this is breaking up.  It is normal for the noncompete to have a specific time limit and restricted to a specific geographic region.  Noncompetes are complete common in this situation.  I don't think that this is a factor that has much, if any, leeway.

As far as the valuation, I'll take a look at the numbers again and get consultation on it.  In the meantime, what do you feel is an appropriate price, and how would you justify that price?  While Sassy has shown an increase in profitability from the first year to the second, it is still a relatively new venture and its profitability as a business is somewhat uncertain in the future.

I apologize for not seeing this sooner, but I cannot sign it in its present form. The non-compete is totally unacceptable, and I think the valuation is insultingly low. Please talk to Pickle and see if there is some way to resolve these issues.

Boone

Hey Boone,

Have you read through the partnership dissolution agreement yet?  Please do so asap so we can get this going.  If you are fine with all the terms, you can sign it and send it back to me.  If you do that, I'll have Pickle sign it.  Then, I will give you both a copy of the signed agreement.

Gem
