I apologize for not seeing this sooner, but I cannot sign it in its present form. The non-compete is totally unacceptable, and I think the valuation is insultingly low. Please talk to Pickle and see if there is some way to resolve these issues.

Boone

Hey Boone,

Have you read through the partnership dissolution agreement yet?  Please do so asap so we can get this going.  If you are fine with all the terms, you can sign it and send it back to me.  If you do that, I'll have Pickle sign it.  Then, I will give you both a copy of the signed agreement.

Gem
