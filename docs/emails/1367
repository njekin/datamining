I'm sure you've seen this website before, but you ought to look at http://www.someecards.com/. Their e-cards (and now paper cards I think) are all very simple designs. They all look alike also, having a common theme. You could do something like that.

Do you know anyone from this business or ever shopped there? I tried to get Sassy in there but they said it wasn't for them, but I'm thinking this might be right up their alley. I might go talk to them
