Boone,

I hope you are doing well.  Please look over the attached partnership dissolution agreement and tell me what you think.  A few things to note - Pickle did not accept your offer of $2000 for the equipment; therefore, you'll take your equipment and software with you.  Also, I valued Sassy Sentiments at $13,600, which means that Pickle would pay you $6,800 for your part of the business. The price of $13,600 is based on Sassy Sentiments past performance and future expected earnings.  Take a look and let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Gem
