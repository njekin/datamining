Good work. I'm sure it wasn't hard. I think it's just sitting on my bookshelf.

Flight is booked. I lifted your passport from your house the last time I was over. It's pretty easy when your infatuated with a new chick. I'll send the confirm # when I remember.

Here's the forum where I've been spending a lot of time. Have you sent me the flight confirmation yet? Or have you even booked it?? I figured you needed my passport number and didn't remember giving you that.
