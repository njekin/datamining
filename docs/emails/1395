I don't understand you at all. What would your proper title be?

They should change the titles then - it bugs me. The director of athletics should be directing the althetic program - if he's just fund raising, call him the Chief Butt Kissing/Begging for Funding Officer.

Fundraising is the job of the AD. They have compliance officers for this other crap.

So he's good at kissing tail to get people to open thier pocket books - that counds more like a politician to me, not an athletic director. Give him some fund-raising job since he's so good at it and let someone who knows something about running an athletic program have the AD spot.
