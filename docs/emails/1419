Fundraising is the job of the AD. They have compliance officers for this other crap.

So he's good at kissing tail to get people to open thier pocket books - that counds more like a politician to me, not an athletic director. Give him some fund-raising job since he's so good at it and let someone who knows something about running an athletic program have the AD spot.
