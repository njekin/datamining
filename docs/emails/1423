Please do. It's less out of the way for you than for me. Plus, it'll give me a chance to show you some of the samples I've had shipped in.

Thank you so much. I have a feeling part of the partnership split is going to be a provision that I can't go after any of our old clients, so I'm going to have to find all new ones.

one more simple design: http://www.thestationerystudio.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/catalog.viewProduct/productID/7365/catId/1086/Sailing_In_Invitations.html

I really like where you are going with this. I'll see if I can think of anyone who might be willing to buy from you on a regular basis.

Here's a real simple birth announcement:

Are these examples along the same lines of what you were thinking?

I would like to start a company called Simply Stated. It will be less edgy than Sassy. It will be more focused on personalized invitations, baby announcements, etc. The cards will not include art or graphics  just simply stated messages. What do you think? I could sure use your help.
