hahahaha I was about to ask you the same thing in the other e-mail, then thought better of it. Personally, I do not want a pre-nup. People are free to say I told you so and blah-blah-blah later on if they want. But I truly believe that you have to be able to trust the person that s/he will not leave you and trust in yourself not to leave the other. That being said, if I were to ever enter into a marriage where I already had children, I would probably get a pre-nup. Then it would be not just my interests at stake, but theirs too. Your thoughts?

What do you think of prenups? Not trying to be weird or anything, just curious what your take is
