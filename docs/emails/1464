Here's a real simple birth announcement:

Are these examples along the same lines of what you were thinking?

I would like to start a company called Simply Stated. It will be less edgy than Sassy. It will be more focused on personalized invitations, baby announcements, etc. The cards will not include art or graphics  just simply stated messages. What do you think? I could sure use your help.
