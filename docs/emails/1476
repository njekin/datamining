First of all, I believe the Sassy name has significant value. The company has been growing steadily and we have an excellent reputation with our customers. As for the physical assets, I think we should look at replacement value. What would it cost Sassy to go out and buy these items today? The software is basically the same, but of course the other items would be less. I think $2000 is a fair price, otherwise I will just keep them. That is my position so there is no need to haggle.

If Pickle would be willing to buy the physical items you gave to Sassy Sentiments in the beginning (i.e. computer, printer, scanner, software), would you agree?  Originally, you valued the items around $3,500.  If you were willing to sell, how much would you want for them (those items are now two years old and have depreciated in value)?  If you don't want to sell, that is fine too.  It is up to you.

As far as the brand of "Sassy Sentiments," do you feel like that is well known in the greeting card community?  Do you see this brand growing?  I am getting both your opinion and Pickle's opinion on this before coming up with a financial figure for Sassy Sentiments.

Thanks,
Gem

Boone,

Do you have a company balance sheet?  That information would be helpful in determining a price for your part of the partnership.

Thanks,
Gem

Attached are the updated checkbook and income & expense statements. I went ahead and filled out the information for September because I don't plan on doing any more work for the partnership this month. I received a check this morning from Blink for an order I sent out which should hold them over until we get this all figured out. Let me know what other information you need. 

Boone
