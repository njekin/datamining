I sure hope it doesn't rain tomorrow. If it does rain, maybe we could just watch the game on my couch. One rainy game a season is enough for me. I don't care enough about UAB to sit in the rain. If it's not rainy though, I definitely want to go.

Here's a real simple birth announcement:

Are these examples along the same lines of what you were thinking?

I would like to start a company called Simply Stated. It will be less edgy than Sassy. It will be more focused on personalized invitations, baby announcements, etc. The cards will not include art or graphics  just simply stated messages. What do you think? I could sure use your help.
