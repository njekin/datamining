Boone,

Do you have a company balance sheet?  That information would be helpful in determining a price for your part of the partnership.

Thanks,
Gem

Attached are the updated checkbook and income & expense statements. I went ahead and filled out the information for September because I don't plan on doing any more work for the partnership this month. I received a check this morning from Blink for an order I sent out which should hold them over until we get this all figured out. Let me know what other information you need. 

Boone
