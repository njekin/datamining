Here's the blog I was telling you about last night. http://www.possessionista.com/  It's a guilty pleasure! But it's so fun to see the clothes that the characters wear on some of my tv shows. It also makes me feel a little better about all the money I DON'T spend on designer clothes...

Callie,
I'm just driving home from dropping you off and I can't help myself from saying one last goodnight, not that the goodnight you gave me at your doorstep wasn't good enough, but I can't express how happy I am to be with you, and I can't wait to see you tomorrow. 

Boone
