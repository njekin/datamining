Well aren't you sweet!! I am very happy to be with you as well. But I'm NOT happy about you e-mailing me from your phone while driving. That is not safe! I love your sweet e-mails, but please, don't send them while driving :)

Callie,
I'm just driving home from dropping you off and I can't help myself from saying one last goodnight, not that the goodnight you gave me at your doorstep wasn't good enough, but I can't express how happy I am to be with you, and I can't wait to see you tomorrow. 

Boone
