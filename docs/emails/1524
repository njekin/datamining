Callie and I had a great time and you were a wonderful host. You know how much it pains me to say that, but you acted perfectly civilized. I really think you like her more than Pickle. Maybe a little too much, but all the same, we really enjoyed dinner and she's already asked me when we can hang out again. Thanks for helping us put this whole Pickle mess behind us. Talk to you tomorrow. 

Boone
