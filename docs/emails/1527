I'm on my way, just passing West Hills. Pick you up in 15.

I think you're exactly right. There's no reason to waste your talent simply because you and Pickle broke up. I'd love to shoot around ideas with you! Thanks for asking. I definitely will keep quiet about it tonight though.

Since my business with Pickle is over, I'm thinking of starting my own card business. I was fairly successful at it before, so why not keep it going. I don't think I should quit just because we broke up. I've got a few ideas I want to talk to you about, but I want to keep it a secret from my brother for now so let's not bring it up tonight at dinner. 

Boone
