Boone,

Ok.  I'll start talking to Pickle about it.  I'll let you know what she says.  We can start discussing the specific terms of a buy-out option (as long as Pickle wants to buy your portion of the partnership from you).  I'll be in touch.

Gem

Gem,
I want out of the partnership. I think it's time she and I went our separate ways. Just let me know what you want from me. I trust you'll help us through this.

Boone,

So, are you saying that you want to break up the partnership?  It sounds like you want out of Sassy Sentiments completely.  If that is the case and Pickle wants to keep the business, one option is that you can buy her out of her part of the partnership.  If we go through with that, we'll have to go through your financial records/documents and what the brand of Sassy Sentiments is worth overall and figure out what a fair price would be for your part of Sassy Sentiments.  There would be other options if neither of you wanted Sassy Sentiments to remain.

How do you want to proceed from here? Do you want me to contact Pickle about this?  I can see if she is interested in buying out your portion of the Sassy Sentiments.  I can be a buffer between you two. 

This will all work out, Boone.  If your goal is to have Pickle buy out your portion of Sassy Sentiments, I can have this done quickly and efficiently.  

Gem

Gem,

As I'm sure you've already heard, me and Pickle are basically finished. I've been trying to figure out a way to salvage our partnership but I honestly don't think it is possible at this point. I want to know what my options are for getting out of the business. Thank you for your help in this matter.

Boone
