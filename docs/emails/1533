Tonight or tomorrow works, or any other time this week for that matter. Just let me know. The good thing about working for yourself is you can always walk away from your desk whenever you want (even thouhg it may mean walking back to it at midnight).

I think you're right about that. What night is good for you? We can all have dinner.

So when are you going to bring this new chick around? You know the easiest way to get her attached to you is to show her what an awesome brother/family you have.
