Sorry we never got a chance to talk today, but hopefully we'll have plenty of time to talk tomorrow at dinner.

You're right -- tomorrow is a new day. I know tonight is hard for you, but tomorrow will be a better day.

I'm sorry you had to get caught up in this too. If I had any idea she would just show up like that...but tomorrow is another day and we can move forward and stop pretending to just be looking at properties together.

I do want to be honest with each other, and every one else, about our relationship. I just hate that it hurt someone else.

I completely understand, but I want you to also understand that this was never going to be easy. I am willing to go through this if it means we can be honest about our relationship. Everything will work out, I just want to be with you. None of this is your fault.

No, I'm sorry to have interfered. It was such an awkward situation, and I just wanted to get out of there as quickly as I could.

Callie,
I'm sorry about what happened at dinner. I'm really embarrassed but I want you to know that I still mean everything I said about us. I'll talk to you soon. 

Boone
