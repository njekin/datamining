No, I'm not doing a happy dance. You're still my brother even if you dated a girl I thought was way below your standards. I'm not happy that you're having to deal with this crap, but I do think you're better off without that rail-thin, haughty piece of city trash hanging around. 
 
Don't worry too much about the business thing. It will work itself out. 
 
Good luck with the new chick. 
 
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help speed the situation along (legal advice, hangin out to take your mind off things, making a call to one of my Army buddies to say "hello" to Pickle for you, etc.)

That's not very nice. I would never say anything hurtful about you. But I hurt your feelings so if you feel you need to vent then by all means go ahead.

Sassy doesn't need you. You can spend your time working for 8 bucks an hour at that stupid newspaper for the rest of your life for all I care.

You have every right to be upset right now, and if that's your decision then I'll accept it. But I have done nothing but work every day to grow the value of the partnership.
