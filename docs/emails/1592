I don't need to vent to you. I don't need to ever speak to you again. 

DON'T CALL.

DON'T TEXT. 

DON'T WRITE. 

EVER AGAIN. 

P.S. I hate you.

That's not very nice. I would never say anything hurtful about you. But I hurt your feelings so if you feel you need to vent then by all means go ahead.

Sassy doesn't need you. You can spend your time working for 8 bucks an hour at that stupid newspaper for the rest of your life for all I care.

You have every right to be upset right now, and if that's your decision then I'll accept it. But I have done nothing but work every day to grow the value of the partnership.
