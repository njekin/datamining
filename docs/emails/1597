No, She's gone. I've got some pretty angry emails already. She can't comprehend what she's saying right now. Hopefully she'll calm down soon and we can figure out where to go from here.

Is Pickle still there, or did she already leave? She seemed pretty upset.

Callie,
I'm sorry about what happened at dinner. I'm really embarrassed but I want you to know that I still mean everything I said about us. I'll talk to you soon. 

Boone
