It would be. But you want to make sure she knows that you mean business. You don't know what other tricks she has up her sleeve. If you take a stand now, she might not try to screw you in the future.

Hopefully not too many thousand. I mean I still have the money I got from Pickle but I don't really want to spend it all trying to get a few more bucks out of her. That would be really sad.

I'd say you would have to put down a pretty large retainer, a couple thousand dollars maybe. I wonder how much an attorney would charge per hour for something like this.
