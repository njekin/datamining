Pickle,
I want you to know that I never cheated on you. I didn't want to break your heart. I've been trying to figure out what I was going to say to you tomorrow. This is difficult for me too.

Oh, and you will never be my business partner again. I can't believe you were having a romantic dinner with her on the night before I was coming into town. You are such a loser and she is gonna figure out how much of a ass you really are. 

I hope she breaks your heart like you broke mine
