Sassy doesn't need you. You can spend your time working for 8 bucks an hour at that stupid newspaper for the rest of your life for all I care.

You have every right to be upset right now, and if that's your decision then I'll accept it. But I have done nothing but work every day to grow the value of the partnership.
