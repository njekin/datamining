No, I'm sorry to have interfered. It was such an awkward situation, and I just wanted to get out of there as quickly as I could.

Callie,
I'm sorry about what happened at dinner. I'm really embarrassed but I want you to know that I still mean everything I said about us. I'll talk to you soon. 

Boone
