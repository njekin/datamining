I cannot believe you would do this to me. I can't even see straight I am so upset right now Boone. We were supposed to get married and have a family. What are you even  thinking??? The REAL ESTATE AGENT??? Seriously? Do you even know anything about her? Boone we have been together for so long. You WILL regret this Boone
