It was a great game. I always pull for the Colts. The Colts looked really good.

I'm pretty pumped about the Colts v. Giants game tonight. Who are you pulling for? I think I'm pulling for the Colts. Although I do always like it when Eli wins, since Peyton seems to be the more popular brother.

Unfortunately, yes. I would have like it to be closer, but I don't think anyone really thought we would win.

I just got home from the game. What a day! Was the score about what you predicted?

Do you just want me to pick you up? I know it's kind of out of the way, but I just thought I would ask.
