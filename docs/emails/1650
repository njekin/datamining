I've been trying to! If we could just find you a great workspace, I think we would both be thrilled.

Yes, my famous sausage ball are quite delicious. I figured I should finally bring something you've been taking such good care of me.

I was so glad you were able to stop by the tailgate today. Thanks for bringing some sausage balls too! They were delicious.

Do you just want me to pick you up? I know it's kind of out of the way, but I just thought I would ask.
