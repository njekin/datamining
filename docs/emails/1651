Brunch was delicious. I hope you don't think we're spending too much time together, but I really just can't get enough.

Brunch should be fun tomorrow. I was happy to hear you would be able to make it. It's  bit much to spend on lunch, but their buffet is definitely worth it. And after all, it's good to splurge every now and then!

Do you just want me to pick you up? I know it's kind of out of the way, but I just thought I would ask.
