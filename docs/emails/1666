This was a great find too. I'm glad we both liked it. I'll set us up another viewing in a week or so.

This one also just posted. It's more money per square foot than the other one I just sent in Bearden, but it is new, nice, and has a great location. This is off of Middlebrook Pike near Weisgarber. We will see it at 3:15 on Friday.

That would be awesome. Where's our last showing so we can talk about a place?

Oh, and of course, continuing with our tradition, we can do drinks or dinner after our last showing on Thursday if you want!

Yeah, that is a great location, but that price is completely unreasonable. I mean, just look at all the empty space in Windsor square. How can they expect to fetch those prices?

This is also a great location. The buildings are older though, so I am sure we can get them down on a price.

So what day do you want to hang out this week?...I mean look at properties. We have to be able to expense these dinners.
