I've set us up a showing for this property at 3:00. I hope you're available! If not, let me know and I'll change it.

 Check this out! It's on Market Street downtown and is decently priced. Parking wouldn't be ideal, but you cannot beat the location. Very "sassy."

Unfortunately, yes. I would have like it to be closer, but I don't think anyone really thought we would win.

I just got home from the game. What a day! Was the score about what you predicted?
