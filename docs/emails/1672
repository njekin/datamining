I usually go into games thinking the outcome will be one way or the other, but I really didn't know about this one. When we converted on that fourth down and scored the touchdown in the fourth, I really thought we were going to pull it out. Oh well, there's always next year!

Unfortunately, yes. I would have like it to be closer, but I don't think anyone really thought we would win.

I just got home from the game. What a day! Was the score about what you predicted?

Do you just want me to pick you up? I know it's kind of out of the way, but I just thought I would ask.
