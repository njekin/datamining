Just picked it up. Thanks again. Do you think if I had any spare female buddies I'd still be with Pickle? Besides, don't you have some sort of committed relationship? I forget what they're called.

Knock yourself out. Its out back like always. If you run out of room a few of them can crash over here (dibs on any female buddies).

I've got a bunch of buddies coming in and they're all crashing at my place. Can I borrow your air mattress?
