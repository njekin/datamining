Sorry I'm blowing up your e-mail tonight. Although that seems to be how we roll these days.... I know you will be here in a few, but I just didn't want to forget to ask you about brunch on Sunday. Have you been to brunch at Lakeside Tavern? It's fabulous. Would you be down with "brunching" on Sunday?

Do you just want me to pick you up? I know it's kind of out of the way, but I just thought I would ask.

Boone
