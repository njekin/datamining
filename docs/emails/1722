Hope you had a good time. I looked at some more places today but nothing is working out. I'm starting to think we may need to rethink our plans.

Went out with some friends tonight for a few drinks but came home early. I'm headed to bed and I think you are still in some meeting so I will just say goodnight on here. Miss you Boone! You are the love of my life!
