I think some of those neighborhood women put a few shots up on the web - now you'll have all sorts of lucky women and men seeing your glory.

Sorry. I meant to say glorious. And yes I actually did have it on. You should have seen the looks from the lucky neighborhood women passing by.

Did you actually just use the word "gorgeous" in a serious sentence? Sounds like you had your man-thong on while washing the car. Maybe next time you'll take your manhood with you when you go outside.

No, just had an outside day. It was gorgeous. Washed the cars and did some yard work.
