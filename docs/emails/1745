On the record - Everything I've talked about with you regarding Pickle, your business, and my practice is made in jest. I don't get serious until I have an official client on my hands - then everything is by the book. 
 
On a different note - "telephonically" . . . did you seriously use that word?

Tempting but maybe we shouldn't be making a record of these conversations. They could be subject to discovery. I propose we discuss this telephonically from now on.

She thinks we need a better office space. Right now, we might as well have a PO Box, but with all the money she's sitting on.... Personally I think it could be put to better use.

Why exactly do you guys need a new real estate location? What's wrong with where you are right now?

Pickle is still hounding me about finding this place. I'm about to give up on the whole thing and tell Pickle it was a bad idea to start with.

Well, like I said - she's been filled in now so no worries.

Thanks bro. We've kind of avoided the whole Pickle subject.

Speaking of crazy - I met the real estate chick you've been talking about. She's definately classier material than Pickle (and much hotter too). I told her you were "with" Pickle just to get an angle on the card business so don't be surprised if she comes on to you a little stronger now that big brother is watching out for you.
