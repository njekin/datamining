This was just posted and looks great! Fabulous location in Bearden. The price is right too. I've set up a viewing on Friday at 4:00.

That would be awesome. Where's our last showing so we can talk about a place?

Oh, and of course, continuing with our tradition, we can do drinks or dinner after our last showing on Thursday if you want!

Yeah, that is a great location, but that price is completely unreasonable. I mean, just look at all the empty space in Windsor square. How can they expect to fetch those prices?

This is also a great location. The buildings are older though, so I am sure we can get them down on a price.

So what day do you want to hang out this week?...I mean look at properties. We have to be able to expense these dinners.
