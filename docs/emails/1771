That would be nice. The sad thing is I had it in my calendar correctly.

You should get one of those fancy planners! I just use my computer planner but I know you can't exactly whip out a laptop everytime you are in a meeting. Want me to pick a nice manly one out for you??

I'm sorry Pickle. I don't mean to be so rude. How was your day? Mine was busy. Can you believe I messed up an appointment? I thought this guy was coming in for an interview today for this story I'm doing, but he no showed. After several angry phone calls, I realized he was booked for next Tuesday. Don't I feel like a clown?
