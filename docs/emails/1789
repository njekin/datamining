You're probably right - I don't keep up with it enough to know. I just like to be controversial.

I adamantly disagree. I believe he has been an exceptional AD. Maybe he should've given Fulmer one more year, but I honestly believe that decision was taken out of his hands.

Should've fired mike a long time ago. So I guess maybe if we do lose the rest of the season that would be the silver lining.

Dude, if we beat Florida, this town will go crazy. So crazy. Mike just might get to keep his job.

You're probably right - maybe we can upset FL next week. That would be better than beating Oregon

I don't know what's more depressing - the fact that we're going to get killed today or that we're going to get killed by a team named the "ducks." Its about as bad as dating a girl named "pickle."
