No I've never seen it, but a friend told me about it. I thought it was about the band. How funny is that?

Have you seen the movie Killers? I watched it tonight. I thought it was entertaining, but pretty lame. Kind of like a chick-flick they tried to turn into an action movie. Interesting concept.

I know. If we could have just converted TDs on some of those early possessions it could have really scared them.

This massacre is finally over. 48-13. That's so embarrassing. I hate that the score doesn't reflect how close the game was up until halftime.

Here's where we sat today. Total let down. I know that sounds snobby, but seriously, I would advise your friends against it.

Well, I should admit that it was nice to be in the Terrace seats when the mega storm came tonight. Although it was very crowded, it was much nicer hanging out in that air conditioned concourse than being down in the regular concourse. But really, how often is the game suspended for storms?

I'll have to keep that in mind the next time we're looking for a place for dinner. You know that I'm good friends with Sandy Beall, the founder? His wife Chris is delightful and their son Sam is the finest sommelier in all of the Southeast.

This is totally random, but I meant to tell you earlier. I went to Ruby Tuesday to eat this past weekend. Have you been there lately? I was very impressed. There new menu is awesome, but a little expensive. I totally stuffed my face. Then regretted it afterwards.

Anyway, you know I love a good restaurant.

I notice this one is close to the putt-putt place. How do you feel about hitting a few range balls after? I need to get in shape for a big round this weekend.

Actually I had to go into the office for a few hours but overall it was a pretty good day. Beautiful outside

It was so nice to have the day off today! You didn't do any work did you? I sure hope not! It's too pretty outside to work.

Oh, the reason i asked about Hardin Valley is b/c there is a lot of new development out here. You really ought to consider living and working out this way. At some point in the near future, I will give you the "official Hardin Valley tour."

Although the game was a great start for Dooley. If we would have lost, people would have been all over him. So glad he came out with a victory.

Also, did you say the north or south end of G12?
