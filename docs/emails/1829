Right right. I'm just thinking about the cases you can retire on.

Yeah, it all depends on how you set things up in the settlement agreement. I try to get mine up front, which usually isn't a problem since my cases are all small enough payouts that it doesn't hurt anyone too bad to go ahead and pay my bill.

One can hope. Did you know that alot of those big settlements get paid out over decades?

Got a big case coming up. Maybe one of these days I'll win one big enough to quit forever. Good times.
