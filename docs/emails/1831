Pickle is still hounding me about finding this place. I'm about to give up on the whole thing and tell Pickle it was a bad idea to start with.

Well, like I said - she's been filled in now so no worries.

Thanks bro. We've kind of avoided the whole Pickle subject.

Speaking of crazy - I met the real estate chick you've been talking about. She's definately classier material than Pickle (and much hotter too). I told her you were "with" Pickle just to get an angle on the card business so don't be surprised if she comes on to you a little stronger now that big brother is watching out for you.
