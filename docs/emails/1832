Sorry. I meant to say glorious. And yes I actually did have it on. You should have seen the looks from the lucky neighborhood women passing by.

No, just had an outside day. It was gorgeous. Washed the cars and did some yard work.

Haven't heard from you all day - did you get too crazy last night to get out of bed today?
