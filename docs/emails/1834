It's just really hard to find a place that fits all our needs. It might actually be impossible, but if you think you can do it I won't try and stop you.

How is it not her fault? I'm not mad at her or anything, but I do think we could do better. I'm giving her until October to find us something that will work in Knoxville. After that, I'm taking matters into my own hands. Pickle Harris, Real Estate Extraordinaire. How does my new title sound to you??

We haven't paid her anything. She is a fine real estate agent. It's not her fault that we can't find the right place.

You say how great this real estate lady is, but I have yet to see any potential properties that will work for us. Are you sure she isn't just taking our money??
