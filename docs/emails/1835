Dude, if we beat Florida, this town will go crazy. So crazy. Mike just might get to keep his job.

You're probably right - maybe we can upset FL next week. That would be better than beating Oregon

I don't know what's more depressing - the fact that we're going to get killed today or that we're going to get killed by a team named the "ducks." Its about as bad as dating a girl named "pickle."
