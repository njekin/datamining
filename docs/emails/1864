Subject: Grandparent's day
 
Did you guys know that today is grandparent's day? I totally missed that but here are some card ideas for next year:

For Grandparents Day, I'd like to take you to a nice restaurant that you can plunder for Sweet 'N Low packets!

I will always visit you regardless of its effect on my inheritance.

and my personal favorite:

Let's celebrate Grandparents Day by setting our thermostats to 95 degrees and gossiping about our neighbors' health!

Charlotte "Pickle" Harris, Owner
Sassy Sentiments 
Greetings by Design
