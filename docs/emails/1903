Goodnight babe! I will talk to you tomorrow about the properties. We are lucky to have such a devoted and competent real estate agent. She really knows our needs and wants to help us. Sweet dreams.

I'm going over to a friend's house here in a minute so I apologize if I can't answer my phone or respond to your messages for a few hours. He has really bad reception at his house. Actually, I might be more than a few hours. We could go out after the football game but I'll let you know when I'm home.
