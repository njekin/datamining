Thought about it but cops are too expensive. Judges, on the other hand, seem to be pretty cheap. Too bad I'm so ethical - otherwise there would be a goldmine out there waiting to be raided.

Given the way you talk about it, your business must be so bad that you would starve if it weren't for all these federal appointments. You should probably start arranging some bogus deals for the cops just so you can make your fancy car payments.

Sounds good. I'll swing by after work (5:00 ish) and we'll improvise. Gotta take some time away from court - I'm starting to get a contact high off of all the drugies we pile through there each day . . . can't wait until business is good enough at my office to stop taking these federal appointments.
