I know Knoxville! I have been studying the map so I won't get lost when I move up there. I think downtown would be great, but if we can't afford that, then maybe Bearden. It seems like a really great area and there are lots of shops there!

Also, what about location? I know we've talked a little about this. How's your memory of Knoxville geography before I just start dropping locations that you have no idea what I'm talking about?
