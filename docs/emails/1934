Oh, I think we should have room for both. The production space needs to be the biggest of course but I would love to have a small storefront in case we decided to go that direction.

I promised you I would try to keep you in the loop on the properties. I looked at some yesterday, and I want your thoughts on a few things. Do you think we need space more suited for production or retail? Originally I was thinking we just needed a place to ramp up production and let the vendors sell the cards, but with all the places I've been looking I wondered if we might want our own storefront as well.
