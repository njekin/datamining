Good thinking. Got to keep those cards close to the chest. Actually, do you gamble? I was thinking of running over to Cherokee one night.

Perfect! I'll give it a little time, so we don't look too eager. It's never good to look too eager once negotiations start.

I would love another viewing. Maybe I can bring my brother. He has some experience in renovating.

So glad we both loved this one! I agree, it will take a lot of work to fix up and maintain, but it is such a classic building. Let's sit on it for a few days, think about it, and we can schedule another viewing if you are still interested.

This is fun! And adjacent to downtown! We can view it at 1:00 tomorrow.

Actually I had to go into the office for a few hours but overall it was a pretty good day. Beautiful outside

It was so nice to have the day off today! You didn't do any work did you? I sure hope not! It's too pretty outside to work.

That sounds good. Should we put that on the schedule for this week

Oh, the reason i asked about Hardin Valley is b/c there is a lot of new development out here. You really ought to consider living and working out this way. At some point in the near future, I will give you the "official Hardin Valley tour."

Although the game was a great start for Dooley. If we would have lost, people would have been all over him. So glad he came out with a victory.
