That's funny. I hadn't thought about the fact that you're drafting it. Doesn't that give me grounds to contest it?

I would if I didn't think you would end up drowning us both int he process. Take it from me - its lonely at the top. You got the better end of the deal - no expectations. Still, I guess I'll end up better once the will comes through (especially since I'm the one drafting it - you better stay in line if you want your fair share).

I'm glad you see it that way too. I'm sure M & D feel the same way. Just once I would like to be the favorite son. Maybe you could pretend to drown and I could rescue you.

I would love to be the worthless brother for once. Unfortunately, it seems you have that job tied down for the forseeable future. I'll have to find a way to squeeze money out of the country - maybe livestock or timber. I admit it is sounding like a better and better idea each time I think about it.

Exactly what I'm thinking. I'll be the scuba instructor and you can be the tour guide. Or I could be the travel writer and you could be the worthless brother.

Sound like we both need a new line of work. Maybe we won't come back from NZ when we go this Spring.

I may be pretty busy. Real estate agent, work, work, and more work but I'll drop you a line one night.

What's going down next week - it looks like I'll be slow again so holler at me if you get some down time.
