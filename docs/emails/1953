I still can't believe you had 3 hole in ones. Who is that lucky? It's like I was playing with Sam Snead and Jack Nicklaus's love child.

I notice this one is close to the putt-putt place. How do you feel about hitting a few range balls after? I need to get in shape for a big round this weekend.

Actually I had to go into the office for a few hours but overall it was a pretty good day. Beautiful outside

It was so nice to have the day off today! You didn't do any work did you? I sure hope not! It's too pretty outside to work.

Oh, the reason i asked about Hardin Valley is b/c there is a lot of new development out here. You really ought to consider living and working out this way. At some point in the near future, I will give you the "official Hardin Valley tour."

Although the game was a great start for Dooley. If we would have lost, people would have been all over him. So glad he came out with a victory.
