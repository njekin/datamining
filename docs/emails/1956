How many times do I have to remind you that I don't have facebook? Facebook is the spawn of satan - it sucks an entire 20 hours out of each day everytime you log on.

All in good time - like I said, maybe we'll just stay once we get there.

I figured several months of prep time would give us plenty of warning. Once we get a little closer we'll start looking at what excursions we may want to book in advance. Should be solid.

Awesome. Just awesome. You're the best bro and I'm really psyched. At least we have plenty of time to do some planning

Booked us for New Zealand next spring (April).
