I'm still partial to the plum, but that was definitely a twist on the usual. I had great time and I can't wait to talk to you tomorrow.

Oh, and if you're up for it, we can do happy hour when we get done! It would be great to debrief on the properties we saw.

Actually I had to go into the office for a few hours but overall it was a pretty good day. Beautiful outside

It was so nice to have the day off today! You didn't do any work did you? I sure hope not! It's too pretty outside to work.

Oh, the reason i asked about Hardin Valley is b/c there is a lot of new development out here. You really ought to consider living and working out this way. At some point in the near future, I will give you the "official Hardin Valley tour."

Although the game was a great start for Dooley. If we would have lost, people would have been all over him. So glad he came out with a victory.
