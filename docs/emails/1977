I hope you and Gem had a great dinner. I had a delicious California Burger. I'll have to make it for you next time you're in town. Thanks for all your hard work.

Hey baby! Hope you are having a great day at work. I stayed late at the office tonight, finishing up an order. I am just about to head home and make some yummy dinner. I might even invite Gem over to eat at my place. I miss you babes!
