I'm glad you see it that way too. I'm sure M & D feel the same way. Just once I would like to be the favorite son. Maybe you could pretend to drown and I could rescue you.

I would love to be the worthless brother for once. Unfortunately, it seems you have that job tied down for the forseeable future. I'll have to find a way to squeeze money out of the country - maybe livestock or timber. I admit it is sounding like a better and better idea each time I think about it.

Exactly what I'm thinking. I'll be the scuba instructor and you can be the tour guide. Or I could be the travel writer and you could be the worthless brother.

Sound like we both need a new line of work. Maybe we won't come back from NZ when we go this Spring.

I may be pretty busy. Real estate agent, work, work, and more work but I'll drop you a line one night.

What's going down next week - it looks like I'll be slow again so holler at me if you get some down time.
