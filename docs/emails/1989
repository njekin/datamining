I was pretty impressed with this property. You just really need to think about where you want to live and whether this would be convenient. Also, you should think about whether or not you are wiling to deal with renting the extra space to other businesses. There could be a lot of money had there! Heck, you might even be able to pay your mortgage with the rent from the other tenants. That would take a lot of pressure off of you for making a profit! Just think about it.

This is a TON of space for a great price!! Even if you couldn't use all the space now, it would be good for expansion. You could always lease the extra offices. We'll see this one at 2:15

Actually I had to go into the office for a few hours but overall it was a pretty good day. Beautiful outside

It was so nice to have the day off today! You didn't do any work did you? I sure hope not! It's too pretty outside to work.

Oh, the reason i asked about Hardin Valley is b/c there is a lot of new development out here. You really ought to consider living and working out this way. At some point in the near future, I will give you the "official Hardin Valley tour."

Although the game was a great start for Dooley. If we would have lost, people would have been all over him. So glad he came out with a victory.
