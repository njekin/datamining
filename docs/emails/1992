Its ok baby, I can do the creative ones! How about this for a work related card:

"The hurricane isn't coming anywhere near here, but I say we evacuate anyway" 

With a pic of people sneaking out of the office! We could even use a picture of Jim and Pam from "the office" as the sneakers. What do you think??

I swear I've racked my brain all week and can't come up with anything good for a card. Everything is either too localized, too fleeting, or too polarizing. Maybe we should drop the current events for now and stick to what YOU'RE good at it.
