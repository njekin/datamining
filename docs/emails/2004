Here's a new place that just opened on the strip. I was able to talk them into taking a few cards, and we'll see how it goes. I know they'll sell fast and they said they would be interested in our next ground-breaking idea. It's a small order but it could grow. Also, I changed the name for our deluxe line. It sounded a little boring. Let me know what you think. I'm not married to the name or anything.  

Boone

Every 7 seconds? I thought it was 5. Anyways, here is this weeks Blink invoice. I hope you find the new terms I negotiated to be favorable. Just remember, they're our biggest customer so we need to keep them happy. I'm going to try and churn out one of those experimental card ideas so they bring in the big bucks.

I'll send you the updated invoice for this weeks shipment. 

I'm all for keeping our fern healthy but we can't neglect our daily responsibilities in the name of love. I have a lot of work to do up here and so do you down there. We're strong enough to last a few weeks without seeing each other, right?

Babe! We won't see eachother for a long time if you wait until after the Florida game. I will come visit you before then I guess. We have to see each other every now and then to keep our love fern growing and healthy! You know? 

By the way, what is the new price on the Blink cards? I just want to keep a record of what we are charging everyone.

You know how football season is up here. There's no way I could get down there until after Florida weekend.
