This is a TON of space for a great price!! Even if you couldn't use all the space now, it would be good for expansion. You could always lease the extra offices. We'll see this one at 2:15

Actually I had to go into the office for a few hours but overall it was a pretty good day. Beautiful outside

It was so nice to have the day off today! You didn't do any work did you? I sure hope not! It's too pretty outside to work.

Oh, the reason i asked about Hardin Valley is b/c there is a lot of new development out here. You really ought to consider living and working out this way. At some point in the near future, I will give you the "official Hardin Valley tour."

Although the game was a great start for Dooley. If we would have lost, people would have been all over him. So glad he came out with a victory.
