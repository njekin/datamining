Booked us for New Zealand next spring (April). I know its a ways off but I got it cheaper that way and we'll have something to look forward to now. flight and room is covered courtesy of your's truly (throwing the big lawyer bucks around) . . . you just need to make sure you have plenty of spending and food money.
