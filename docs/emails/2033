I could - but then again I have a lot of old buddies that owe me favors so I can just put them in harms way and still get paid. Of course, if I did collections then I'd get to beat up crack heads instead of represent them for  change. Could be worth it.

Guess I'll have to send my Ex-Army Ranger Collections Agency guy after you. Hope you don't need both of your knees.

Don't expect payment for that bill anytime soon

Maybe if you'd take that chain off your neck you wouldn't have to run around doing your woman's bidding. If she's so concerned about it, tell her to find the property herself.

I'll be sending you a bill for the advice above, seeing that it solves one of your life problems.

I've been looking a lot but I'm about over it. If pickle wasn't so set on it I would've given up by now

By the way, how goes the property search? It seems like you've had some good leas - any plots you think may work out?
