I'll send you the updated invoice for this weeks shipment. 

I'm all for keeping our fern healthy but we can't neglect our daily responsibilities in the name of love. I have a lot of work to do up here and so do you down there. We're strong enough to last a few weeks without seeing each other, right?

Babe! We won't see eachother for a long time if you wait until after the Florida game. I will come visit you before then I guess. We have to see each other every now and then to keep our love fern growing and healthy! You know? 

By the way, what is the new price on the Blink cards? I just want to keep a record of what we are charging everyone.

You know how football season is up here. There's no way I could get down there until after Florida weekend.
