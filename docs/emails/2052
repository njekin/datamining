I'm beginning to feel the same way. She's riding me about coming down to see her. Hello? Little busy up here right now. Between running her card business and working fulltime for the paper and she's got me out there looking for commercial space 20 hours a week. Sorry, little vent there.

How did you make out yesterday? I lost track of you after tailgating. Game was good - I predict it will be one of four we win this year.

Was there any "overtime" with the real estate chick?
