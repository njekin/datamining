Babe! We won't see eachother for a long time if you wait until after the Florida game. I will come visit you before then I guess. We have to see each other every now and then to keep our love fern growing and healthy! You know? 

By the way, what is the new price on the Blink cards? I just want to keep a record of what we are charging everyone.

You know how football season is up here. There's no way I could get down there until after Florida weekend.
