Meant to tell you -- I went the the UT Young Alumni event tonight. Bob Keasling and Tim Priest spoke. They had some really funny stories about their years in broadcasting. Andre Lott also spoke about his new position with the UT football program. You should read about it. He is doing like a "character counts" type job, helping the players build strong characters on and off the field. It was a cool event!

Also, did you say the north or south end of G12?
