Yeah, me too. It's important to understand that these things take time. I am glad you are being so understand. We've looked at a lot of property, but that's what it takes to find a good deal.

Even though we didn't find anything today, I want you to know that I had a great time looking. I'm looking forward to the tailgate tomorrow.
