Today was great! I took off work early because my sister came into town. I told you about her visit last night, didn't I? Well anyway, we went hiking and had a great time. FAbulous weather down here today. How was your day sweetie?

I spoke with Blink and they agree that at the time of the volume discount discussion our cards were not as varied and labor intensive as they are now. The next invoice I send you will reflect the new pricing scale. Ok. That was the last of the business emails for now. So how was your day?

Boone
