Let me know if they screwed you - my old Legal Profession professor always said I needed to be a personal injury attorney so maybe I can start taking cases like yours (if they stole your info or something) and work my way up to the big cases. Special family contingency rate of 20%.

Sorry just got your message. I wiped my phone last night and flashed a new ROM. Then realized I had wiped all my email accounts and can't figure out how to reload them. Sometimes I wish we still used carrier pigeons or those owls in Harry Potter.
