You can look but I think we should stick with who we have. They are working very hard on it but we've given them a difficult task.

Eww. That place looks a little dirty. Can we afford something a little bit nicer?? Also, maybe we should consider getting a new real estate agent. We have been looking for a place for over a month now (in a buyers market I should add) and still don't have anything to show for it. Could I look around and hire someone new??

Just to give you an idea of why I haven't been wasting your time with every last place I've looked at. See what I mean? Just terrible. But I promise as soon as I find something worth your attention, I'll have you up here so fast to look at it. I know you want to be involved and I'll try to do better. G'Night Pickle
