I agree we should be charging more but I think we promised them a volume discount a while back before we had so many different products. Ill talk to them about it.

Hey babe, I was just looking at the Blink invoice you sent me and noticed that we are charging the same amount ($2.00) for all of the different types of cards they order. Shouldn't the "deluxe artwork" and "hand- styled" cards be more expensive? I really wanna make sure we are financially ready for this move!

Here's the invoice for all of August. I will be sure and stay on top of these from now on. We can't get paid if we don't invoice right? Sorry I've been so distracted lately.

I know. Those are the invoices I was talking about last night. You will have them by the time you get to the office tomorrow.

Hey Baby! This organization idea is really coming along. The office looks great! Maybe I should try to color code my apartment too. What do you think?? 

On another note, could you send me any Blink invoices that you have? The Blink file down here is empty  - which means that we forgot to make copies of the records for the GA office again. Opps! Send me the Blink orders as soon as you have time so I can get that fixed!

Love you!
