I was just reviewing all the listings you sent me, and I thought we could get together and discuss them. How do you like barbecue?

This place doesn't really have that Sassy feeling. Sans segue, what are you doing for lunch tomorrow?

I had a blast today too. I'm glad I could get out of work early so that we could move things up, because Tuesday, like we planned, will be super busy for me.

This one is in the Old City. It has so much charm! Parking in that area is a little tough though.

Lunch today was great. I think we work really well together. Can you believe the way that waiter was hitting on you? How did he know we weren't together? Anyways, let me know when you have those viewings lined up. My brother said he has some leads that I'll be forwarding to you soon.
