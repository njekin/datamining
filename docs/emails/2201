Just to give you an idea of why I haven't been wasting your time with every last place I've looked at. See what I mean? Just terrible. But I promise as soon as I find something worth your attention, I'll have you up here so fast to look at it. I know you want to be involved and I'll try to do better. G'Night Pickle
