I know. Those are the invoices I was talking about last night. You will have them by the time you get to the office tomorrow.

Hey Baby! This organization idea is really coming along. The office looks great! Maybe I should try to color code my apartment too. What do you think?? 

On another note, could you send me any Blink invoices that you have? The Blink file down here is empty  - which means that we forgot to make copies of the records for the GA office again. Opps! Send me the Blink orders as soon as you have time so I can get that fixed!

Love you!
