I'm sorry I haven't been keeping you in the loop. Nothing really much to see here. I'll send you a few of the ones I've looked at but there's really nothing to get excited about yet. I did look at few places this week, but it's so hard to find the right fit. I don't know about the agent's website. I'll get back to you on that. 

Boone

Hey Boonie! Miss you this morning! How is the real estate search coming? Have you heard anything from the agent this week? Do you have any links to send me? Also, does the real estate lady have a webpage? I really want to be involved and it's hard to feel included down here in GA. 

Charlotte "Pickle" Harris, Owner
