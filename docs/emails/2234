I can go for that - but only if I get to use Pickle as my skis.

I don't come up with the cards, pickle does. You're doing a lousy job of looking good in court, so I think this might be just the publicity you need for your new ad campaign. Wouldn't a picture of you jumping out of helicopter look great on every billboard and bus in town.

Definately you. I get paid to look good in court - you get paid to come up with "sassy" jingles to put on cards. Thus, nature's sense of fairness would dictate that you get desingated as the face-planter,

I can't find a single youtube video of a guy faceplanting when jumping out of helicopter. I guess because the people heli-skiing are good enough that doesn't happen but it's still surprising. Just think, we could have the first and only video of that happening. Who's it going to be? me or you?
