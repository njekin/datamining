Hey Boonie! Miss you this morning! How is the real estate search coming? Have you heard anything from the agent this week? Do you have any links to send me? Also, does the real estate lady have a webpage? I really want to be involved and it's hard to feel included down here in GA. 

Charlotte "Pickle" Harris, Owner
Sassy Sentiments 
Greetings by Design
