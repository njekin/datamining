I'm pretty sure we would lose money on any of my card ideas, but I'll try to think of one that will at least make you smile. I've got our June Balance sheet and the current income and expenses ready to go so I'll send those right over.

I would just love my own copy of all of our records. You know, I just wanna check things out and be involved too! Maybe you could even come up with a Sassy card idea??

Alright sweet pickle, I have a pretty good idea what the final august numbers will be so I can send you the financial stuff. What did you need again?

Thanks babe! I just really want everything to be super organized before the move. With all those new Blink orders we must be rolling in the money right??

Finding tickets shouldn't be a problem. I was kind of planning on going with Nathan though, but I'd much rather go with you. As for the financials, I was just waiting til the August numbers were in. But I can get those to you pronto.

Hey Boonie!!! I miss you already. I should come visit next weekend too! Could you get us tickets to UT's opening game??

Also, could you send me those financial documents I asked for a couple of weeks ago?? I really need to start my color-coding!
