I would just love my own copy of all of our records. You know, I just wanna check things out and be involved too! Maybe you could even come up with a Sassy card idea??

Alright sweet pickle, I have a pretty good idea what the final august numbers will be so I can send you the financial stuff. What did you need again?

Thanks babe! I just really want everything to be super organized before the move. With all those new Blink orders we must be rolling in the money right??

Finding tickets shouldn't be a problem. I was kind of planning on going with Nathan though, but I'd much rather go with you. As for the financials, I was just waiting til the August numbers were in. But I can get those to you pronto.

Hey Boonie!!! I miss you already. I should come visit next weekend too! Could you get us tickets to UT's opening game??

Also, could you send me those financial documents I asked for a couple of weeks ago?? I really need to start my color-coding!
