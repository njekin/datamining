Not really interested in Maryville, but I appreciate you're trying and willing to explore every opportunity.

We haven't looked much in Maryville, but it's definitely a well-populated area. I like this cute little place!

I had a blast today too. I'm glad I could get out of work early so that we could move things up, because Tuesday, like we planned, will be super busy for me.

This one is in the Old City. It has so much charm! Parking in that area is a little tough though.

Lunch today was great. I think we work really well together. Can you believe the way that waiter was hitting on you? How did he know we weren't together? Anyways, let me know when you have those viewings lined up. My brother said he has some leads that I'll be forwarding to you soon.
