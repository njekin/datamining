Of course I didn't see it, what with all the spam you send my way how am I suppose to filter through all of it to know which ones are important. I'll go back through my inbox and find it but I can tell you now that sounds awesome. I've always wanted to go there. Let me email my buddy. I can't remember if he lives on the north or south island and we can probably meet up or he can tells us the places to go.

Did you get the cheap New Zealand ad I forwarded? I'm thinking it would be a solid place to run to here in a few weeks to get away from everything - I've heard there are very few people and people are generally what ruin my day - ergo few people should mathmatically mean a better chance of having a good day. As always, if it is a go I'll cover airfare as your birthday gift as long as you agree to take a bullet for me if we get into any skirmishes with the locals.
