Finding tickets shouldn't be a problem. I was kind of planning on going with Nathan though, but I'd much rather go with you. As for the financials, I was just waiting til the August numbers were in. But I can get those to you pronto.

Hey Boonie!!! I miss you already. I should come visit next weekend too! Could you get us tickets to UT's opening game??

Also, could you send me those financial documents I asked for a couple of weeks ago?? I really need to start my color-coding!
