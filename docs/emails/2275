Did you get the cheap New Zealand ad I forwarded? I'm thinking it would be a solid place to run to here in a few weeks to get away from everything - I've heard there are very few people and people are generally what ruin my day - ergo few people should mathmatically mean a better chance of having a good day. As always, if it is a go I'll cover airfare as your birthday gift as long as you agree to take a bullet for me if we get into any skirmishes with the locals.
