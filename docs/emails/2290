You're right, I just don't think this is the right fit.

We're viewing this one at 4:15. Let's just give it a look!

This is right near my house. There is no way they will get $450,00 for it. It's definitely worth a look. We might be able to get them to partition it. Worth a try!

Have fun in the box. I'll take those seats. See you for the tailgate. What lot you in?

Actually just got a call, and I'll be sitting in the boxes next weekend for the UT game. Kickoff is at 6:00. You're welcome to my seats if you want them! They are in Z11, row 2. Right where the team runs out of the T!

Downtown would be so much fun. Definitely put this one on the schedule. Maybe we can grab some sushi at Nama after?

This one is in the Old City. It has so much charm! Parking in that area is a little tough though.

Lunch today was great. I think we work really well together. Can you believe the way that waiter was hitting on you? How did he know we weren't together? Anyways, let me know when you have those viewings lined up. My brother said he has some leads that I'll be forwarding to you soon.
