Hey Boone,

Thanks for being a such a trooper today. From lunch at Nama to the million properties we looked at, you were such a champ! I know it's frustrating, but if we stick with it, we can definitely get you the best deal for your money.

Callie

This is a pretty packed schedule. Are we trying to fit too much in?

We'll look at this one at 3:45. Again, we just have to keep our minds open!

I really think we ought to take a look at this. The outside is a bit shabby, but the interior looks nice. Seems to have a ton of potential! And the price is definitely right. With all the money you would save, you could renovate the outside.

Lunch today was great. I think we work really well together. Can you believe the way that waiter was hitting on you? How did he know we weren't together? Anyways, let me know when you have those viewings lined up. My brother said he has some leads that I'll be forwarding to you soon. 

Boone
