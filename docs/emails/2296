Hey Baby, Have you heard from the real estate agent today? I was really disappointed that she was unavailable to show properties the whole time I was in Knoxville, but I want to make sure you keep the ball rolling. Send me the links to the places she already showed you - I wanna see our business baby's new home!

Charlotte "Pickle" Harris, Owner
Sassy Sentiments
