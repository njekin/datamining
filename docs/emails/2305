No really. Got a few things I wish someone would steal just to get them out of my house. Thought you might enjoy the target practice if someone did break in - the sawed-off is behind the mantel like always. Have fun.

I have a CLE seminar coming up. Can you swing by my place a in a day or so to pick up the paper and make it look like someone is there? You still have a key in case you need in, right?
