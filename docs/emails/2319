Looks like the property in the Old City will be our first appointment. Do you want to do Nama for lunch at 12:30? Then we can spend the afternoon driving all around town to look at some of these fun places! Let me know.

This one is in the Old City. It has so much charm! Parking in that area is a little tough though.

Lunch today was great. I think we work really well together. Can you believe the way that waiter was hitting on you? How did he know we weren't together? Anyways, let me know when you have those viewings lined up. My brother said he has some leads that I'll be forwarding to you soon.
