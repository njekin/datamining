Lonas is a great area too - right off the interstate. We could definitely talk them down on the price.

Lunch today was great. I think we work really well together. Can you believe the way that waiter was hitting on you? How did he know we weren't together? Anyways, let me know when you have those viewings lined up. My brother said he has some leads that I'll be forwarding to you soon.
