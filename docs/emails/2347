Yeah, pretty much went the way you said. They aren't very pleased with me representing crack heads but somehow the mere fact that I am a lawyer seems to make up for it. One of those wierd laws of nature I guess. Thye asked briefly about you - I recall it invovled a lot of sighing and what not. Anyway, they at least seem to acknowleged you existence.

How did it go with the rents today? Hope you didn't miss me too much. Actually that doesn't even require a response. We both know they wish I was never born since they have you.

Don't worry - Mom and Dad realize how much she sucks. You won't have to worry about them telling you to get married until you bing someone a little higher class around.

Now it looks like Pickle is coming in town so I might have to reconfigure my plans. Either way, I'm not bringing her over for you to give me a hard time and mom and dad to tell me we should get married.

What kind of business plans could a card store guy have that require going out of town? I'll tell Mom and Dad you're avoiding them like always - thereby ensuring my inheritance.

While that sounds like loads of fun I've already got plans. I'll be out of town this weekend on business but we definitely need to hang out when I get back. Give my regards to M and D.

Mom and Dad are planning another trip up here. They probably didn't tell you (since I'm the favorite, dominant child) but we're going to cook out this weekend at my place. Come by if you must.
