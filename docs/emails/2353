You are right, last night was so much fun! Living in Knoxville full time is going to be so great! I can't wait to get all of my stuff up here so I can stop living out of a suitcase every time we are together. Let's see what is playing at that newish theater downtown tonight. I love hanging out downtown, walking around and running into fun people we know. Maybe even hit up that chocolate shop after the movie??
