I'm really excited. How about the Colts game? I'm a big Peyton fan. I know those are probably the most desirable games. Hah. That's funny. While I was typing this a Peyton commercial came on TV. He sponsors everything.

The Titans games are a blast! I'll look at the schedule and try to come up with a good game for you to go to!

Downtown would be so much fun. Definitely put this one on the schedule. Maybe we can grab some sushi at Nama after?

This one is in the Old City. It has so much charm! Parking in that area is a little tough though.

Lunch today was great. I think we work really well together. Can you believe the way that waiter was hitting on you? How did he know we weren't together? Anyways, let me know when you have those viewings lined up. My brother said he has some leads that I'll be forwarding to you soon.
