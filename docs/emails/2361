Tuesday works for me. Later though if that's alright. I have a feeling I'll have a lot of catching up to do when I get back to the office on Monday.

I'm available whenever you are. I just can't wait to look at some more properties with you

Downtown would be so much fun. Definitely put this one on the schedule. Maybe we can grab some sushi at Nama after?

This one is in the Old City. It has so much charm! Parking in that area is a little tough though.

Lunch today was great. I think we work really well together. Can you believe the way that waiter was hitting on you? How did he know we weren't together? Anyways, let me know when you have those viewings lined up. My brother said he has some leads that I'll be forwarding to you soon.
