and how could I forget the Lady Vols?!? We've had season tickets to the Lady Vols basketball games since I was about 7 years old. The tickets are on the 5th row. I know women's basketball doesn't sound exciting, but the Lady Vols are so, so talented. You must come to a game this season!!

Downtown would be so much fun. Definitely put this one on the schedule. Maybe we can grab some sushi at Nama after?

This one is in the Old City. It has so much charm! Parking in that area is a little tough though.

Lunch today was great. I think we work really well together. Can you believe the way that waiter was hitting on you? How did he know we weren't together? Anyways, let me know when you have those viewings lined up. My brother said he has some leads that I'll be forwarding to you soon.
