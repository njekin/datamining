Boone,

Nice to hear from you.  I'll look into it.  My gut instinct (which is always right) tells me that you should just keep the partnership.  Why go though the hassle of incorporating when you already have such a good thing going?!?  Trust me.

Have fun with Pickle this weekend!  I know she is so excited to see you!!!!  

Gem

Gem,
I don't want you to spend a lot of time researching this, but I was wondering if it would be possible to get more financing if Pickle and I were to incorporate instead of operating as partnership. Please don't tell Pickle, but I'm getting concerned we might have some trouble finding a suitable commercial space at the price we're able to currently finance. I'm going to keep looking, but I just wanted to know what our options are. Thanks for your counsel.

Boone
