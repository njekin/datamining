Look Boone, I know about Simply Stated. I can't believe you would violate our agreement and start another card company. Don't try to deny it. I already have one of your cards featuring my design from last Fall. I purchased your half of Sassy Sentiments from you - that means you are OUT of the card business now. Get over it. Sassy is finally starting to grow since you left. Blu Cabinet ordered $26,000 in cards this month and I am recruiting other buyers now. I just want you to know that I will do whatever I have to do to end your Simply Stated business - even if that means a lawsuit. Better stop making cards right now Boone - or call up that sleazy brother of yours....

Ok. Congrats. So you're saying more than $200. That cruise was about 5k each so 10k for you and your sister. So you're saying somewhere between 10k and . . .? Help me out here.

$200? Are you kidding me? I am making WAY more money than that. Remember that cruise we wanted to go on last year but couldn't afford? Well let's just say that I'm going this year and paying for my sister to come with me! :)

So, approximately how much have you made off this deal? $200? $300? I just want to make sure you can handle the volume.

Don't worry. None of this business started until you were completely out of the picture.

Don't worry - Sassy Sentiments is making plenty of money without you on staff. Actually I have a janitor position that might be open if you are job hunting.
