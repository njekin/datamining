If I put myself in my client's shoes I would be trippin on crack - how ethical do you think a man trippin on crack is? As for my Legal Profession Professor, she's the best in the business. She just tends to have a better grasp on reality than all you bleeding heart types out there.

You're awful. I think you should reevaluate if you're in the right profession if that's the way you feel. Try putting yourself in your client's shoes. Who was your Legal Profession prof?

Zealous advocacy only applies when your client doesn't suck at life. It's in the comments to the Rules of Professional Conduct . . . at least that's what my Legal Profession professor taught us when I was still in school.

That doesn't exactly sound like zealous advocacy. I've started a pool for when you get your first complaint with the BPR. $1 a square. Care to join?

Got to represent another crack head in federal court today. Got another 10 year sentence. I think of losing these cases as my little way of giving back to the community.
