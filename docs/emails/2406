	Prospector
	
	 An old prospector shuffled into town leading an old tired mule.
	 The old man headed straight for the only saloon to clear his parched 
	throat.
	
	 He walked up and tied his old mule to the hitch rail. As he stood there, 
	 brushing some of the dust from his face and  clothes, a young gunslinger 
	stepped out of the saloon with a gun in one hand and a bottle of whiskey 
	in the other.
	
	 The young gunslinger looked at the old man and laughed, saying, "Hey old 
	man, have you ever danced?"
	
	 The old man looked up at the gunslinger and said, "No, I never did 
	dance... never really wanted to."
	 A crowd had gathered as the gunslinger grinned and said, "Well, you old 
	fool, you're gonna dance now," and started  shooting at the old man's 
	feet.
	
	 The old prospector --not wanting to get a toe blown off-- started hopping 
	around like a flea on a hot skillet.
	 Everybody was laughing, fit to be tied.
	
	 When his last bullet had been fired, the young gunslinger, still laughing, 
	holstered his gun and turned around to go  back into the saloon.
	
	 The old man turned to his pack mule, pulled out a double-barreled shotgun, 
	and cocked both hammers.
	
	 The loud clicks carried clearly through the desert air.
	
	 The crowd stopped laughing immediately.
	
	 The young gunslinger heard the sounds too, and he turned around very 
	slowly. The silence was almost deafening.
	
	 The crowd watched as the young gunman stared at the old timer and the
	 large gaping holes of those twin barrels.
	
	 The barrels of the shotgun never wavered in the old man's hands, as he 
	quietly said, "Son, have you ever licked a  mule's ass?"
	
	 The gunslinger swallowed hard and said, "No sir..... but... I've always 
	wanted to."
	
	 There are a few lessons for us all here:
	
	 Never be arrogant.
	 Don't waste ammunition.
	 Whiskey makes you think you're smarter than you are.
	 Always, always make sure you know who has the power.
	 Don't mess with old men, they didn't get old by being stupid.
