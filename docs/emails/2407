Hey Boo! My plans are to get done making the newest Blink order early and then hop in the car to come see you. I should be arriving around 6 or 7 I think. Can we do dinner when I get there? I really wanna eat sushi tonight so let's head to nama. There is this great sushi chef named David that can make a mean roll. Can't a wait to see you!!

Charlotte "Pickle" Harris, Owner

So tell me more about your plans. When are you coming? How long are you staying? What do you have in mind? 

Boone
