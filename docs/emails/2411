Now it looks like Pickle is coming in town so I might have to reconfigure my plans. Either way, I'm not bringing her over for you to give me a hard time and mom and dad to tell me we should get married.

What kind of business plans could a card store guy have that require going out of town? I'll tell Mom and Dad you're avoiding them like always - thereby ensuring my inheritance.

While that sounds like loads of fun I've already got plans. I'll be out of town this weekend on business but we definitely need to hang out when I get back. Give my regards to M and D.

Mom and Dad are planning another trip up here. They probably didn't tell you (since I'm the favorite, dominant child) but we're going to cook out this weekend at my place. Come by if you must.
