Oh I forgot to tell you the surprise baby. I am coming to visit you in Knoxville tomorrow! Sooooo since I will be there anyway, can I come visit the potential new Sassy location with you?!?

Not today sweetheart. Looks like Friday will be the next visit. There was a big Glenn Beck rally in town today before they got on the buses to go to DC, so I was out covering that for the paper. I always get the worst assignments.

Hey Booner, what have you been up to today? Did you visit any potential properties for Sassy? If so, send me some pics! Miss you
