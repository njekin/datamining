Oh, and that was a little strange about the waiter! I don't know if I'll be going back there anytime soon. I was waiting for you to step in and pretend to be my boyfriend so he would back off! Thanks for dropping the ball on that one :)

Lunch today was great. I think we work really well together. Can you believe the way that waiter was hitting on you? How did he know we weren't together? Anyways, let me know when you have those viewings lined up. My brother said he has some leads that I'll be forwarding to you soon.
