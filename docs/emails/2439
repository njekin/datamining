Ok, good to know about parking. We can probably find something under 250k. We just have to look harder!

That's true we haven't talked about it. Yet another topic for lunch tomorrow, but preliminarily I would say parking is not really an issue. Right now my main focus is on the price. Do you think we're going to be able to find anything for under 250k? Every placed I've liked has been way over budget.

We also didn't discuss parking. How much parking do you want at your new location?

I guess today is not going to work for either of us. How about tomorrow to go over my notes? Shall we say 1230@ the hilton downtown? Its quiet and they have great sandwiches and salads.
