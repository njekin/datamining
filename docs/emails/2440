You can park in the garage of the hotel. They validate. I'm really looking forward to it. See you then.

Where do you usually park when you have lunch there? In the hotel lot? On the street?

I guess today is not going to work for either of us. How about tomorrow to go over my notes? Shall we say 1230@ the hilton downtown? Its quiet and they have great sandwiches and salads.
