I just wonder what you're going to do with a 6ft tall framed picture of me someday. It's a little over the top for the living room and you don't just throw out a frame that expensive. Maybe we can replace it with a picture of the both of us.

The only way I can sleep at night is when I have that framed picture of you on the pillow next to me. I know you think it's weird that it's life-sized but it's the only thing that comforts me.

Truer words never spoken. Is your mind just constantly racing with all these amazing ideas? How do you sleep at night?

Hello everyone! How is this for a work-friend card?

"Sorry you you can't go on vacation with me since you used up all your vacation days on hangovers." With a picture of a girl getting on off a plane somewhere in the islands. 

Gem, do you like it?? I made it for you and me!
