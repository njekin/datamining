That is so weird. I have no idea what that could possibly be about. Have you been eating spicy food right before bed again?

I know! I think we make it work because we are truly meant to be together forever. Oh, and listen to this: I had a dream last night that we were hiking along this secluded trail in the Smoky Mountains.We stopped at a beautiful overview to look out and take pictures and then you leaned down to do something on the ground, almost like you were getting on your knees or something but then I woke up. It was such a wonderful dream. Do you think it means anything?

It is surprisingly mild all of a sudden. I guess that must mean football season is right around the corner. When are you planning on coming in for a game? I've been staying busy too. It really says a lot about the strength of our relationship that we're able to stay together despite the distance and hectic schedules.

I've missed you today. What have you been up to? I know you're probably swamped with all the work I've thrown on you, but I know you can handle it. Can't wait to catch up.

Boone
