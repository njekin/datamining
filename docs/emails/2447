Hello everyone! How is this for a work-friend card?

"Sorry you you can't go on vacation with me since you used up all your vacation days on hangovers." With a picture of a girl getting on off a plane somewhere in the islands. 

Gem, do you like it?? I made it for you and me!

Charlotte "Pickle" Harris, Owner
Sassy Sentiments 
Greetings by Design
