It is surprisingly mild all of a sudden. I guess that must mean football season is right around the corner. When are you planning on coming in for a game? I've been staying busy too. It really says a lot about the strength of our relationship that we're able to stay together despite the distance and hectic schedules.

I've missed you today. What have you been up to? I know you're probably swamped with all the work I've thrown on you, but I know you can handle it. Can't wait to catch up.

Boone
