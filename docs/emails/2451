I ran a google search to see what we're up against in the current events category. They're all terrible. The ideas off the top of your head put to shame the best they've found worthy of putting into production. You're so awesome. I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

Oh Pickle,
You know I don't have any of your creativity. That's why I spend my days writing up articles about the school lunch menu or reporting on the status of highway construction projects. Things will be so much better when you get here.

I talked to Blink today about your egg card idea. They loved it, but they too are worried about the timeframe. They said they would take 50 if we could get them out by Friday. Can you make it happen? This could potentially become a whole new niche for us: sassy cards that play off current events. What do you think?

Boone
