A vacation is exactly what I need. Why don't you buy the tickets and call an early birthday present? Then I won't be able to say no.

When are you going to ever take a vacation? I've seen some good deals down in the islands lately. Can you find time to go party for a few days or is your neck to sore from Pickle yanking on your dog chain?
