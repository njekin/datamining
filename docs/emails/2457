While that sounds like loads of fun I've already got plans. I'll be out of town this weekend on business but we definitely need to hang out when I get back. Give my regards to M and D.

Mom and Dad are planning another trip up here. They probably didn't tell you (since I'm the favorite, dominant child) but we're going to cook out this weekend at my place. Come by if you must.
