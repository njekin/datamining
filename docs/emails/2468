This is quite possibly the funniest card I've ever read. Pure GOLD! I'm going to send the first one to President Obama. Keep it up, you make my job easier and make me appreciate you even more every day. Talk to you soon.

So guys, I was watching the news just now and trying to think of new card ideas and I came up with this one. It's a card for everyone who is looking for work right now and needs some encouragement. 

The card will have some graphics of the twin towers or an empty ground zero or something with this caption "I'm completely against building a mosque at ground zero....unless they're hiring."
