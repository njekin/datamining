Gem,
I don't want you to spend a lot of time researching this, but I was wondering if it would be possible to get more financing if Pickle and I were to incorporate instead of operating as partnership. Please don't tell Pickle, but I'm getting concerned we might have some trouble finding a suitable commercial space at the price we're able to currently finance. I'm going to keep looking, but I just wanted to know what our options are. Thanks for your counsel.

Boone
