Pickle,
I just got your email. What did Becky say? I wish I could call right now, but my phone is dead. I'll look for you on the chat later. 

Boone

Hey Booner! Call me - I need to talk to you as soon as you get this email. You will not believe what Becky said to me when she stopped by the office earlier!
