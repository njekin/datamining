Yes, I watched it! Funny stuff. I watched while I organized my summer clothes for storage. I can't wait to move up there sweetie! I can't help but pack my bags even though we don't have a place yet. 

How is the real estate search going today?

That is so funny...and timely. Do you think we can get it out in time? I love your creativity. Did you see always sunny last night? There was a funny scene with eggs

Hey guys what do you think about this idea for a fun card?  

The front of the card will have a beautiful picture of a big plate of breakfast with eggs, toast, fruit, and OJ with the caption "Remember, breakfast is the most important meal of the day..."

Then the inside will read "Unless it's eggs, then it will kill you!"

If you guys like it I will have to produce it quickly before the egg recall is yesterday's news. What do you think??
