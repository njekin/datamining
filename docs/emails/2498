1. I will never be your Robin. I would steal all your clients and leave you broke. 2. I hate my life enough as it is why would I want the added misery of being a lawyer 3. Me and pickle are about to make it big so I can spend the rest of my life playing golf and sailing. Thanks for the advice though

I'm still in the card business. The real estate is for the card business. I looked at some places today. I'll do anything to keep me from thinking about how much I hate my job.

	You mentioned doing something with real estate in one of your recent e-mails. What was that all about? When did you branch out from cards to real estate?
