That sounds great. We don't get to hang out enough. We'll just have to take it easy. I remember what happened the last time your girl went out of town. I'm just glad you knew that cop who responded to the call. Later bro.

All joking aside, I do have some free time this week if you want to do something. My old lady is going out of town on a business trip to Florida so we can batchelor it up if you want to. Maybe catch a game or go hang out downtown. 
 
Let me know
