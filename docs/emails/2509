Callie,

I had a really great time looking at properties with you today. It's too bad we didn't find anything, but I think we should keep looking. Should we take a few days off or do you want to go back out tomorrow?

Boone

I just realized I've been talking all business today. I really do appreciate you retaining me, and I'm looking forward to working with you in this process. See you in a bit!

This probably goes without saying, but we need to share our opinions on the various properties once we leave. We don't want the owner or agent to know our thoughts, and that can be detrimental in trying to negotiate a price in the future.

You can just meet me at the property. I'm in the process of setting up a few more showings now.

Callie,
Am I meeting you at your office or at the property? I can't remember what we decided. See you in a few hours. 

Boone

I've set us up an appointment to see this property today at 2:00. Let's at least consider the location, and we can talk them down on the price if you decide it's something you might be interested in.

The only problems I have are the location and price, but everything else looks good.
