Hey Booner, 

I am trying to get a bunch of paperwork organized down here at the GA office and need some files. Could you email me all the financial documents from this year so far. I'm going to organize everything and color code it so its super easy to find and move when I get started packing up for the move to TN. I LOVE YOU BOOOOONNNE!
