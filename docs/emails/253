I got one of those half off depot deals today. It's a sips and strokes class for $17. They are usually $35 per class. You know, it's one of those painting classes where you go with your girlfriends, bring your own wine, and they teach you how to paint a pretty canvas. They say you don't need any artistic ability. I guess we will see how mine turns out. It will be fun though!
