Are you crazy? I'm not going to miss the season opener. It might be the only game we win this year. Plus I'm really busy with Sassy, Pickle, and now this real estate hunting thing. I feel like I need a personal assistant or something.

We're planning a vacation here in about a week. If you have time to get away you may want to drop in on us - we're thinking about hitting up Virginia Beech (Pickle is not invited).
