Do you want to have a retail aspect to this space? Or simply just a space for you all to work?

You really seem to have a good idea what I'm looking for. I'm sure you have something that will interest me.

I'm familiar with this property. It looks like it's for rent and not purchase. Are you willing to rent or do you want to buy? As I mentioned before, I insist you call me Callie :) I look forward to meeting you soon!

Agent Purnia:
I prefer this location, architecture, and price, but it's way too much space for us. I hope you find this guidance useful, and I look forward to sitting down and discussing this with you.
