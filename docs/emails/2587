Hi Boone,

I'd love to work with you. Thanks for getting in touch. And please, call me Callie. What particular qualities are you looking for in an office space? What is the maximum price you are willing to pay? I'll do some looking around and be in touch soon.

Looking forward to working with you!
Callie
