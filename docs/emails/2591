I'm about to crash out. I've got a big day tomorrow. I just wanted share what I was listening to as I fall asleep.

That week in Paris was probably the best of my life, and every time I hear this it reminds me of our night out at the Opera House and all the fun we had afterward. To this day, I still can't believe that crazy cab driver on the way back to the hotel. 

Sweet dreams,

Boone
