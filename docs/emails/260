Yeah, I've been on 3. The first one was with my grandmother in Hawaii, so of course it was nice. The second one was really nice too. The third one was for Spring Break my senior year in college. It was really cheap b/c the boat was old. I was sick all week. While it was fun, I was definitely ready to get off the boat by the end. I'm not sure I'll go on another one for a while.

I can't begin to imagine what that was like. I've never been a big cruiser anyway.
