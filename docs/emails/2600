Pickle juice:
I hope you got your car back alright. I'm so glad the weekend is finally here. You and the girls enjoy EPL. I'm almost finished with the book and have no desire to see the movie because I heard they butcher it just like every movie adaptation. Talk to you later tonight

Hey sexy, just wanted to let you know that I'm going out with the girls tonight so I won't be available on my cell. Don't worry I don't think there are that many sexy guys watching Eat, Pray, Love tonight so I should be safe. Kisses!
