Just keep digging on Pickle. Keep your cards close to your chest until we have enough to nail her to the wall.

Subject: Blu Cabinet deal


So, I just noticed that the announcement was made on Blu's website on October 19. That's less than 5 days after I signed the dissolution agreement. That seems awfully fast to put together a deal like this. Especially considering that the deal would have to be in place and cards on the way before they would draft and post an announcement like that.
