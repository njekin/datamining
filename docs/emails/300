Sami,

I appreciate your business. It will be my pleasure to help a friend of Callie. You should expect a proof soon and your order will follow promptly. I look forward to serving you. Have a nice day. 

Boone Radley

Boone,

My name is Sami Surrey, and I know your girlfriend through the Junior League
of Knoxville. I was hoping that you could put together some invitations for
my Christmas party. Yes, it is a Christmas party, not a "holiday" party. It
is going to be on Saturday, December 18 at 7:00 PM at my house. My address
is 5324 Lakeview Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee. Please list my husband and I
as the hosts: Brad & Samatha Surrey. Please have them e-mail me with RSVPs
at samisurrey@gmail.com by December 10. Also, could you just put this little
jingle at the top of the invitation? "The Christmas season is drawing near,
so let's celebrate with holiday cheer!"

I will need about 75. I look forward to hearing back from you!

Thanks,
Sami
