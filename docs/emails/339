Apparently the Presbyterian Church downtown owned it and just sold. Cedar Springs Pres is right across the street. I heard that they wanted to buy it for years. It's an interesting connection, for sure. Maybe they didn't have enough money.

That's really cool. I've been driving up and down cedar bluff for years and never gave it any thought at all.

This property has been undeveloped for as long as I have been alive. I always knew it would be worth tons of money, but goodness... It's also interesting b/c the other Kroger is just about 2 miles away. Yep, you can just call me a Knoxville-native-nerd.
