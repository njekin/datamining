So I got writer's block earlier and took a break to watch Oprah on DVR. The story today was about this couple who lost all three of their kids - two girls and a boy - in a car accident. One year later, they had triplets - two girls and a boy. What a miracle! The whole point of the show was talking about how life gets better after the grief passes. It was pretty powerful. You know how I love my Oprah.
