Be sure to avoid telling Pickle about anything you have done with Blink - I'm still not sure if you violated the non-compete but there is a good chance you may have - either way, we don't want her to have any ammo against you especially as we start to put the screws to her over her possible FD violation.

I'm not sure. It would depend on whether she had the deal rolling before the dissolution was finalized. If she did, then you can't get a set half of the vlaue of the deal but we may be able to argue that she breached her fiduciary duty to you as a partner in the dissolution talks by not revealing valuable information that would have allowed us to better value the future worth of the business. 

 

We can;t really do anything until we have some evidence that this deal was in the works before the dissolution went down.

Do you think I can sue Pickle for half the value of this Blu Cabinet deal?
