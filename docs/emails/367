From what you told me, Pickle seems to have broken her fiducairy duty to you as a business partner. We can likely sue her for this under Tennessee common law and possible under partnership law. 
 
I advise you to see what else you can find out from her - use whatever technique you like that's within the law - anything you can find out about her business dealings with the other company will give us a good idea of how good a case we have if we want to sue.

I'll play to her ego. Instead of going in attack mode, I'll start out by letting her think I'm just really impressed.

Like I said - see if you can find out from her whether she knew about this before the dissolution. Sweet talk her if you need to - jsut find out when this deal first was in the works.

I've been trying to get pickle to push her friends at Blu Cabinet to let us in for years and two weeks after I'm out she's in. That's ridiculous.
