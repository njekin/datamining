Dear Tonya, 

Since you know Callie, I'll give you 10% off the typical rate. How many do you need? 

Boone

Hi Boone, 

My name is Tonya, and I go to church with Callie. I just love your girlfriend! You are a lucky man.

I heard that you are in the business of creating customized invitations. I am having a New Years Eve party, and I am looking to order some invitations. I have included the information below. How much would you charge?

Thanks,
Tonya
