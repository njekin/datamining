Well, I sure am glad that I bought the sports package on my cable. I really thought the game was on CBS. Who would have thought that's not the same as CBS College Sports.

Why do we need to go out? You've got everything I could want or need at your place.

Sorry, I didn't mean to be bossy. We can still go out tonight if you want, but I know we are both trying to pinch pennies right now. It would be cheaper to watch the game here! But it's up to you.
