That's an interesting observation. It could be true!

I think the Beale Street people orchestrated it being a night game. That way everyone heads straight downtown after the game.

Oh by the way, the game tonight is on CBS, so we won't have to order it. I really thought it was on pay-per-view too. I think pay-per-view might have had it at the beginning of the season, then CBS picked it up. I have no idea why though, since both teams are so terrible. Who would have thought UT-Memphis would be a night game?
