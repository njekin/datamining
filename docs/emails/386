Even cooler that I get paid $100 an hour to know it. On a side note, start keeping a list of things Pickle tells you or that you discover that relate to her relationship with Blu Cabinet. Aslo, try to be extra smooth in the neext few days to see what we can figure out about her dealings with them - maybe ask her to dinner as a peace offering so you can "congratualte" her for her newfound success. We need all the dirt we can get if we're going to sue.

Like I said - the main issue here is that she had a fidcuiary duty of loyaty, care, adn good faith to you as a business partner. If she knew about this deal while dissolution agreements we going down, then she breached that duty to you. This is basic agency law - TN case law definately backs it up.

It would help if I had some firepower before I confronted her about it. I can just see the grin on her face now.
