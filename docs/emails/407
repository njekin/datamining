UNIFORM LAW COMMENT

Section 803(a) is drawn from UPA Section 37.  It provides that the partners who
have not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up the partnership
business.  Wrongful dissociation is defined in Section 602.  On application of any
partner, a court may for good cause judicially supervise the winding up.

Section 803(b) continues the rule of UPA Section 25(2)(d) that the legal
representative of the last surviving partner may wind up the business.  It makes
clear that the representative of the last surviving partner will not be forced to
go to court for authority to wind up the business.  On the other hand, the legal
representative of a deceased partner, other than the last surviving partner, has
only the rights of a transferee of the deceased partner's transferable interest.
See Comment 8 to Section 601.

Section 803(c) is new and provides further guidance on the powers of a person who
is winding up the business.  It is based on Delaware Laws, Title 6, Section
17-803.  The powers enumerated are not intended to be exclusive.

Subsection (c) expressly authorizes the preservation of the partnership's business
or property as a going concern for a reasonable time.  Some courts have reached
that result without benefit of statutory authority.  See, e.g., Paciaroni v. Crane
, 408 A.2d 946 (Del.Ch.1979).  An agreement to continue the partnership business
in order to preserve its going-concern value until sale is not a waiver of a
partner's right to have the business liquidated.

The authorization of mediation and arbitration implements Conference policy to
encourage alternative dispute resolution.

A partner's fiduciary duties of care and loyalty under Section 404 extend to
winding up the business, except as modified by Section 603(b).
