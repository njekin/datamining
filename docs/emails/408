 Title 61. Partnerships (Refs & Annos)

+      Chapter 1. Revised Uniform Partnership Act (Refs & Annos)

+       Part 8. Winding Up Partnership Business

>>       s 61-1-802. Partnership continues after dissolution


(a) Subject to subsection (b), a partnership continues after dissolution only for
the purpose of winding up its business.  The partnership is terminated when the
winding up of its business is completed.



(b) At any time after the dissolution of a partnership and before the winding up
of its business is completed, all of the partners, including any dissociating
partner other than a wrongfully dissociating partner, may waive the right to have
the partnership's business wound up and the partnership terminated.  In that
event:


(1) The partnership resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never
occurred, and any liability incurred by the partnership or a partner after the
dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if dissolution had never
occurred;  and


(2) The rights of a third party accruing under s 61-1-804(1) or arising out of
conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or received a
notification of the waiver may not be adversely affected.

UNIFORM LAW COMMENT

1. Section 802(a) is derived from UPA Section 30 and provides that a partnership
continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business, after
which it is terminated.  RUPA continues the concept of "termination" to mark the
completion of the winding up process.  Since no filing or other formality is
required, the date will often be determined only by hindsight.  No legal rights
turn on the partnership's termination or the date thereof.  Even after
termination, if a previously unknown liability is asserted, all of the partners
are still liable.

2. Section 802(b) makes explicit the right of the remaining partners to continue
the business after an event of dissolution if all of the partners, including the
dissociating partner or partners, waive the right to have the business wound up
and the partnership terminated.  Only those "dissociating" partners whose
dissociation was the immediate cause of the dissolution must waive the right to
have the business wound up.  The consent of wrongfully dissociating partners is
not required.

3. Upon waiver of the right to have the business wound up, Paragraph (1) of the
subsection provides that the partnership entity may resume carrying on its
business as if dissolution had never occurred, thereby restoring the scope of its
business to normal.  "Resumes" is intended to mean that acts appropriate to
winding up, authorized when taken, are in effect ratified, and the partnership
remains liable for those acts, as provided explicitly in paragraph (2).

If the business is continued following a waiver of the right to dissolution, any
liability incurred by the partnership or a partner after the dissolution and
before the waiver is to be determined as if dissolution had never occurred.  That
has the effect of validating transactions entered into after dissolution that
might not have been appropriate for winding up the business, because, upon waiver,
any liability incurred by either the partnership or a partner in those
transactions will be determined under Sections 702 and 703, rather than Sections
804 and 806.

As to the liability for those transactions among the partners themselves, the
partners by agreement may provide otherwise.  Thus, a partner who, after
dissolution, incurred an obligation appropriate for winding up, but not
appropriate for continuing the business, may protect himself by conditioning his
consent to the continuation of the business on the ratification of the transaction
by the continuing partners.

Paragraph (2) of the subsection provides that the rights of third parties accruing
under Section 804(1) before they knew (or were notified) of the waiver may not be
adversely affected by the waiver.  That is intended to mean the partnership is
bound, notwithstanding a subsequent waiver of dissolution and resumption of its
business, by a transaction entered into after dissolution that was appropriate for
winding up the partnership business, even if not appropriate for continuing the
business.   Similarly, any rights of a third party arising out of conduct in
reliance on the dissolution are protected, absent knowledge (or notification) of
the waiver.  Thus, for example, a partnership loan, callable upon dissolution,
that has been called is not reinstated by a subsequent waiver.  If the loan has
not been called before the lender learns (or is notified) of the waiver, however,
it may not thereafter be called because of the dissolution.  On the other hand, a
waiver does not reinstate a lease that is terminated by the dissolution itself.
