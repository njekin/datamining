West's Tennessee Code Annotated Currentness

 Title 61. Partnerships (Refs & Annos)

+      Chapter 1. Revised Uniform Partnership Act (Refs & Annos)

+       Part 8. Winding Up Partnership Business

>>       s 61-1-807. Settlement of accounts among partners


(a) In winding up a partnership's business, the assets of the partnership,
including the contributions of the partners required by this section, must be
applied to discharge its obligations to creditors, including, to the extent
permitted by law, partners who are creditors.  Any surplus must be applied to pay
in cash the net amount distributable to partners in accordance with their right to
distributions under subsection (b).



(b) Each partner is entitled to a settlement of all partnership accounts upon
winding up the partnership business.  In settling accounts among the partners, the
profits and losses that result from the liquidation of the partnership assets must
be credited and charged to the partners' accounts.  The partnership shall make a
distribution to a partner in an amount equal to any excess of the credits over the
charges in the partner's account.  A partner shall contribute to the partnership
an amount equal to any excess of the charges over the credits in the partner's
account, but exclude from the calculation charges attributable to an obligation
for which the partner is not personally liable under s 61-1-306.


(c) If a partner fails to contribute the full amount required under subsection
(b), all of the other partners shall contribute, in the proportions in which those
partners share partnership losses, the additional amount necessary to satisfy the
partnership obligations for which they are personally liable under s 61-1-306.  A
partner or partner's legal representative may recover from the other partners any
contributions the partner makes to the extent the amount contributed exceeds that
partner's share of the partnership obligations for which the partner is personally
liable under s 61-1-306.


(d) After the settlement of accounts, each partner shall contribute, in the
proportion in which the partner shares partnership losses, the amount necessary to
satisfy partnership obligations that were not known at the time of the settlement
and for which the partner is personally liable under s 61-1-306.


(e) The estate of a deceased partner is liable for the partner's obligation to
contribute to the partnership.


(f) An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a partnership or a partner, or a
person appointed by a court to represent creditors of a partnership or a partner,
may enforce a partner's obligation to contribute to the partnership.
