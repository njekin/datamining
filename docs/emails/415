No. I wanted to go to both the Lady Vols on Tues and the men on Wed, but I've been swamped with work this week. Remember I've got the MPRE on Saturday? Plus 3 papers I am working on. It's not been a fun week....

Well Dooley is saying that Simm's comments had nothing to do with it. He is saying that the problems are not all even Simm's fault. But being 2-6, they have to change something up.

I listened to a bit of Dooley's press conference today. Apparently Tyler Bray is starting on Saturday. Your thoughts?
