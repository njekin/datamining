Dear Boone,

Thank you for taking care of this. I apologize that I was unable to answer your e-mail earlier this week. I feel quite ill and was unable to get out of bed. However, I do hope that you can still get these invitations to me by the 8th.

Thank you,
Mrs. Henry Dubose

	Mrs. Dubose, 

	It would be my pleasure to personally see that this order is filled promptly and to your satisfaction. I will send you a mock-up shortly and if it meets with your approval, I can overnight the cards this weekend to be there by Monday the 8th. The premium will simply cover the cost of overnight shipping and the quick turnaround to our printer. I look forward to serving you in this regard. 

	Boone Radley

	Dear Mr. Radley, 

	I am Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. It is my understanding that you make personalized stationery. I have an urgent request of you. I need a formal invitation for a Thanksgiving Dinner that I am hosting in Atlanta, Georgia. I will send this invitation to 50 of my friends and relatives. I am willing to pay a premium to have the cards delivered to me by November 8. I realize this is short notice, but I am in quite a bind. Can you help me?

	Here are the details:
