I can almost guarantee she knew about this. This sorts of deals don't happen overnight. Plus, it explains the rush to get the deal signed.

If Pickle knew about this then we've got a problem - or she does, more specifically. She should have told us about this so we could get a better estimate of future profits. Maybe this is why she was so eager to more than triple her initial offer to get rid of you. Send her an e-mail when you get time asking her if she knew about this before the dissolution.

Do you think they knew this was in the works before the buyout? This is a potentially huge revenue stream. What can we do about it?

You really need to find out more about this Boone. I don't want Callie profiting off of your work!
