s  7:34. Contracts violating common law-Noncompetition agreements-Restraint of
trade-Sale of business


   Frequently, where A sells its business to B, the agreement will provide that B
will not engage in the same business for a prescribed time and in an identified
territory. Thus, where A owns the only pizza parlor in a college town, which has a
high volume of business, and contracts to sell it to B, then B will lose much of
the benefit of the bargain if A could open another pizza restaurant in the same
neighborhood. This covenant illustrates a clash of interests between A's right to
protect itself from undue competition versus B's right to pursue a livelihood.
These problems become heightened where A sells its good will along with the
business, such as the name of the parlor, and then A's new pizza store seeks to
capitalize on the good will A previously conveyed to B where A solicits its old
customers (although a sale of good will by itself does not necessarily imply an
agreement for the seller not to engage in the same business).[1]

   Noncompetition agreements appertaining to the sale of a business are
disfavored.[2] Absent a contrary statute, however, courts will enforce these
agreements when reasonable and if they go no further in time and space than
affording a fair and reasonable protection to the buyer. In considering the
reasonableness of a restraint, courts consider the buyer's need to secure fair
protection in receiving the benefit of its bargain, the nature of the business,
how it has been conducted, and the extent of the territorial coverage.[3] The
other factor in the balance is the public interest, which is paramount.[4]
Restrictive covenants in the sale of a business also can be valid where the
particular business lacks either an established practice or professional good will
or is not a mercantile business.[5]

   Two public interests are at stake with these agreements: ensuring honesty and
fidelity among parties by upholding their contracts, and the community interest in
a person's being able to sell property on the most advantageous terms possible.[6]
Further, these covenants usually promote the good will of the buyer in the
enjoyment of what the buyer is purchasing, along with the physical assets and
investments.[7] To ensure consistency with these interests, courts hold that where
the covenant restricts competition from the seller, it is ordinarily neither the
purpose nor the effect of the provision to stifle competition generally in the
locality, or to prevent competition in a way injurious to the public.[8] Unless
the injury to the public manifestly outweighs the policies of honesty in
businesses dealings and a party's right to sell property on its own terms, the
restrictive covenant is enforceable.[9]

   Case law in Tennessee is relatively sparse for determining the validity of
noncompetition agreements in contracts for the sale of a business. The decisions
regarding restrictive covenants in the employer-employee context are "useful
guidelines," but are not controlling, in this area.[10] In fact, many
jurisdictions allow greater latitude in restraints ancillary to sales of
businesses than in covenants in contracts of employment because of the undue
hardship on the promisor-employee and the more equal bargaining power of parties
in the sale of a business.[11] On the other hand, courts considering restrictive
covenants in the sale of a business do rely on many of the same concepts from the
employer/employee context, to include:

   (1) The initial question is whether an enforceable agreement exists apart from
the restraint on trade.[12]

   (2) The parties must exchange valuable consideration.[13]

   (3) The standard rules of interpretation control these agreements, such as the
rule that the primary rule of interpretation is to ascertain the parties' intent,
and that parties are presumed to execute a valid, rather than an invalid,
contract.[14]

   (4) The restrictions can be implied or express, under the principles of
contract interpretation.[15]

   (5) A total ban on engaging in a trade at any place in the realm will be void;
the agreement must have geographical limits, although the decisions conflict on
the need for time restraints.[16]

   (6) The federal antitrust laws do not prohibit reasonable restrictions in the
sale of a business,[17] and these agreements are assignable.[18]

      continued profitable operation) (good discussion)).


      Goodwill is "'[t]he probability that the old customers will resort to the
      old place.'" Zimmer Melia & Associates, Inc. v. Stallings, 2008 WL 3887664,
      at *8 (M.D. Tenn. 2008), quoting Liquidators of Nicholson Pub. Co. v. E.S.
      Upton Printing Co., 152 La. 270, 93 So. 91 (1922). In Tennessee, an
      obligation not to enter into a similar business will not be implied from a
      mere sale and transfer of good will. Zimmer Melia & Associates, Inc. v.
      Stallings, 2008 WL 3887664 (M.D. Tenn. 2008) (citing Jackson v. Byrnes, 54

      restraints do not create an improper monopoly); Baird v. Smith, 128 Tenn.

      Bradford & Carson v. Montgomery Furniture Co., 115 Tenn. 610, 92 S.W. 1104

      (1952) (agreement for sale of business not against public interest where
      unlimited in time, and where it was reasonably limited in territorial
      coverage).

      [FN5] See Matthews v. Barnes, 155 Tenn. 110, 293 S.W. 993, 52 A.L.R. 1350

      discussion).

      [FN8] Scott v. McReynolds, 36 Tenn. App. 289, 255 S.W.2d 401 (1952). Compare
      6 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts, s 13:9 (4th ed. 1995) (where sale
      of business is made just to shut it down and stifle competition, the
      covenant is an illegal restraint of trade) (citing Kaset v. Combs, 58 Tenn.
      App. 559, 434 S.W.2d 838 (1968)); Restatement (Second) of Contracts, s 188,
      cmt. c, cmt. f (stating policies); Comment, Covenants Not to Compete: The
      Tennessee Cases, 31 Tenn. L. Rev. 450, 454-55 (1964) (same).

      [FN9] Greene County Tire & Supply, Inc. v. Spurlin, 207 Tenn. 189, 338
      S.W.2d 597 (1960).

      [FN10] Total Car Franchising Corp. v. L & S Paint Works, Inc., 981 F. Supp.
      1079 (M.D. Tenn. 1997). See also 6 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts,
      s 13:6 (4th ed. 1995) (guiding principles for the two categories of
      agreements are not, strictly speaking, the same or similar).

      In every Tennessee case in which a restrictive covenant ancillary to the
      sale of a business has been considered, the party against whom the covenant
      was enforced had signed a noncompete agreement that was unambiguously part
      of the sale of a business. Zimmer Melia & Associates, Inc. v. Stallings,
      2008 WL 3887664 (M.D. Tenn. 2008) (rejecting out of state decisions finding
      an employee's restrictive covenant ancillary to the sale of a business where
      the employees changed hands in the course of a corporate buy-out).

      (4th ed. 1995); Comment, Covenants Not to Compete: The Tennessee Cases, 31
      Tenn. L. Rev. 450, 460-61 (1964). See also Viad Corp. v. Cordial, 299 F.
      Supp. 2d 466 (W.D. Pa. 2003); Alexander & Alexander, Inc. v. Danahy, 21
      Mass. App. Ct. 488, 488 N.E.2d 22 (1986) (cases noting distinction);
      Restatement (Second) of Contracts, s 188, cmt. b.

      Restrictive covenants that are ancillary to an employment agreement are
      viewed less favorably than those covenants ancillary to the sale of a
      business. Zimmer Melia & Associates, Inc. v. Stallings, 2008 WL 3887664
      (M.D. Tenn. 2008) (also stating noncompete agreements ancillary subject to
      the sale of a business ensures that the former owner will not walk away from
      the sale with the company's customers and good will) (citing this treatise,
      s 7:34).

      A noncompete ancillary to a business does not attach automatically to a
      principal shareholder in the sale of a business. Zimmer Melia & Associates,
      Inc. v. Stallings, 2008 WL 3887664 (M.D. Tenn. 2008).

      Tire & Supply, Inc. v. Spurlin, 207 Tenn. 189, 338 S.W.2d 597 (1960) (sale
      of business subject to limitations of time and space as to reasonableness)
      with Turner v. Abbott, 116 Tenn. 718, 94 S.W. 64 (1906); Scott v.
