Subject: Extra Large Group Seating for Ole Miss



Dear Students,
Our request period for Homecoming Football tickets (UT vs Ole Miss) will take place this Wednesday and Thursday (Nov 3 and 4).  Per Homecoming tradition, we will be offering large group seating for this game.  Maximum group size has been expanded from 150 to 250 this year in response to student feedback. 

Large Group seating will work in the same manner as standard group seating.  Go to BigOrangeTix for full details regarding the group seating process. 

NOTE:  You will want to emphasize to your group members the need to claim their ticket during the claim period.  This is the same as for any other game.  Significance of this for group seating is that unclaimed tickets become available to other students during the Open Sales Period.  This results in non-affiliated students and guests being placed into unclaimed seats in the middle of your group!

Please call the Dean of Students Office at 974-8587 with any questions that you may have. 

Happy Homecoming!
BigOrangeTix
