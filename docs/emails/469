I'm not sure. It would depend on whether she had the deal rolling before the dissolution was finalized. If she did, then you can't get a set half of the vlaue of the deal but we may be able to argue that she breached her fiduciary duty to you as a partner in the dissolution talks by not revealing valuable information that would have allowed us to better value the future worth of the business. 

 

We can;t really do anything until we have some evidence that this deal was in the works before the dissolution went down.
