If Pickle knew about this then we've got a problem - or she does, more specifically. She should have told us about this so we could get a better estimate of future profits. Maybe this is why she was so eager to more than triple her initial offer to get rid of you. Send her an e-mail when you get time asking her if she knew about this before the dissolution.

Do you think they knew this was in the works before the buyout? This is a potentially huge revenue stream. What can we do about it?

You really need to find out more about this Boone. I don't want Callie profiting off of your work!
