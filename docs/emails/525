Thanks for looking into it. Let me know if there is anything I can do to stay out of the grey area.

Well, you can pretty much count on Pickle throwing a fit then. Let me do some research on non-competes to let you know how smug to be when she calls ranting. You may or may not be in the clear on this one - it depends on exactly what you're into with these customers and exactly what Tennessee case law says about the situation.

She might be hearing about me soon. A friend from Blink, one of Sassy's big customers, heard about my new company and offered to help.

You still need to fill me in on what's going on. Regardless of whether you can stay below Pickle's radar, I need to know what's coming at us if she does decide to fly hot.

Plus, I'm really small and can surely stay below her radar. She's way down in GA.
