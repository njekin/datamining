She might be hearing about me soon. A friend from Blink, one of Sassy's big customers, heard about my new company and offered to help.

You still need to fill me in on what's going on. Regardless of whether you can stay below Pickle's radar, I need to know what's coming at us if she does decide to fly hot.

Plus, I'm really small and can surely stay below her radar. She's way down in GA.
