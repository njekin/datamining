Did you hear that Mariah Carey is pregnant? I'm not afraid to admit that I've always been a big Mariah Carey fan...

I got the settlement money and all that, but now she is hinting that she blames for some dropoff in orders. Remember a while back when I told you how I might have let slip to one of her customers that I had some reservations about her ability to fill the orders without me. Well, they didn't order as much this month and I think she blames me.

I'm the worst about locking my car. Until very recently, I always left the keys in the cupholder, but I'm trying to do better. The only valuables in there are my golf clubs. What kind of car burglar steals golf clubs?

I went to Party City today to get decorations for my mom's b-day party next weekend. For some reason, I did not think about the fact that Halloween is 2 weeks away. You should have seen the line to try on costumes. I never even knew Party City had a fitting room!

I had one of those sonic burgers they keep advertising. I'm a sucker for tv ads. If it looks good on tv, you can just about guarantee I'll end up eating it.

Are you talking about the one Davis is running against Desjarlais? I couldn't believe my ears. 




Random thought, but I'm watching the news, and these political ads are getting a little out of control. I don't usually watch the dinnertime news. Apparently that's when most of the ads are.

I spoke to my friend Erica today, and she said that she sent you an e-mail. I will give you a warning -- Erica is a really nice lady, but she is a stickler for a good deal. She practices law on her own, so she cannot afford to spend a fortune on stationery. I told her you would give her a good deal. I know you won't let me down!

On Friday, Blink! Urban Fashions, one of Sassy's biggest customers, called to place an order with Sassy Sentiments but I told them I couldn't place the order for them. I told them they would have to talk to Pickle. When they asked why, I just said that she is handling all new orders, but I might have also hinted that I wasn't sure she'd be able to fill them. As soon as I said it I knew I shouldn't have, but now it's really eating at me. I had to tell someone. Thanks for being there for me.
