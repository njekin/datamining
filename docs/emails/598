Oh, you know about that huh? I was going to surprise you. I'm trying to sneak in a 5 day head start. What do you think?

You're not thinking of participating in no-shave November are you?

Why thank you. But I even forgot to shave yesterday so I had the double 5 o'clock shadow going.

hahahaha that made my day! You do kind of look like you could be running for political office. You have that all-American boy kind of look.

Yes indeed. I had to go down to Loudon for a story this afternoon, and after I got back I went down to city-county building to vote and this old lady came up to me and asked which candidate I was. I must look like a real grown-up. When did that happen?

I just got this email from my brother. I had asked him for advice on this Blink thing. Do you think I should just tell him the truth?

First, tell her to piss off . . . you've severed business ties at her request, remember? You don't have to forward her anything. 
 
Second, I need to know if her accusations have an weight to them. Who exactly is Blink (I'm assuming a card shop) and did you have anything to do with thier decrease in business with Pickle? If not, no problem - just ignore her and be thankful she's out of your life. But if you are connected somehow, I need to know b/c the dissolution agreement did have a non-compete. You don't want to violate that provision . . . it'll lead to a huge headache. 
 
Anyway, definately don;t forward anything to Pickle. Just fill me in on what's going on and we'll tighten things up so you'll have nothing to worry about. 
 
How's that $40,000 treating you? 
 
PEace out

The last few days, Pickle has been asking me about one her big clients, Blink, she said they only ordered $500 worth of cards this month when they usually order $3,000. She thinks I somehow interfered. She wants me to forward her all my contact with them since the break-up. What do I do?
