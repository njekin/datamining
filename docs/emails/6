I think you should go ahead and sue. I might be able to find an attorney for you that would take the case base on contingency, but more than likely they will want some sort of retainer up front. I'm not sure what they will charge so let me run down a few options for you and see what they would ask for. 

 

I'd take the case myself but there are too many potential confict of interest issues for my blood. Anyway, plan on suing soon and I'll try to run down an attorney for you within the next few weeks. Keep in mind it is the holidays so it may take longer.

I don't really want to have to spend the entire settlement just to get a few more bucks out of her.
