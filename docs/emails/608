Very good point. I'm still learning about all of these ethical obligations.

It's not just that he's my brother. I know I could never mess up that relationship. I'm more worried about him being my lawyer and having some ethical obligation to inform Sassy. Or at the very least, he'll ride me until I shut it down.

We can definitely talk more about it. Do you think he needs to know? I know its hard because he is your brother. You don't want to mess up that relationship. But I'll support you in whatever you do.

I told him exactly what I told Blink, but I'm still not sure now is the time to tell him about Simply. Maybe we can figure this out together before we take it to him.
