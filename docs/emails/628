OK - that's good. No contact with Blink or other customers - and I'm assuming no contact means no passive business that you set up before the break up - right? 
 
That takes care of part of the non-compete - you aren't allowed to do any card business with anyone - not just customers of Sassy. Are you doing anything else that may violate the clause this way?

I have literally had no contact with Blink or any other Sassy customer since a few days after me and Pickle broke up. Let alone by the time the agreement was signed. She's on her own. Maybe she should just ask Blink why they didn't order so much instead of crying to me about it.

So what's the deal with Blink right now? Are you still doing business with them (or anyone else for that matter) or did it all end when the deal with Pickle finally settled? 


You need to tell me what's going on so we can make sure Pickle is jus bluffing.

Ok. I guess it must have got lost, but I said something to the effect of I'm not sure she can handle it.

I'm not worried about what you did before the non-compete went into effect - I'm worried about what's going on right now (i.e. after the non-compete went into effect). 


I'll take a look at the e-mail once you send it. Hopefully we won't have any issues. 
  
I'll be in touch

I'll forward you the exact email I sent to Blink and you can decide for yourself if you think it's a problem. Personally, without the benefit of a legal education, I don't see how anything I said could be construed as violating a non-compete that wasn't even in effect yet.

First, tell her to piss off . . . you've severed business ties at her request, remember? You don't have to forward her anything. 


Second, I need to know if her accusations have an weight to them. Who exactly is Blink (I'm assuming a card shop) and did you have anything to do with thier decrease in business with Pickle? If not, no problem - just ignore her and be thankful she's out of your life. But if you are connected somehow, I need to know b/c the dissolution agreement did have a non-compete. You don't want to violate that provision . . . it'll lead to a huge headache. 


Anyway, definately don;t forward anything to Pickle. Just fill me in on what's going on and we'll tighten things up so you'll have nothing to worry about. 


How's that $40,000 treating you? 
  
PEace out

The last few days, Pickle has been asking me about one her big clients, Blink, she said they only ordered $500 worth of cards this month when they usually order $3,000. She thinks I somehow interfered. She wants me to forward her all my contact with them since the break-up. What do I do?
