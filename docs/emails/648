I really hope the pictures survive the forward. I already know a least a dozen people planning on doing the last one, and they're all frat.

[1]Is Your Halloween Costume Racist?

   Some Halloween costumes [2]offend the senses. Some are [3]just plain
   offensive. Here's a handy guide to 12 racially charged Halloween costumes,
   whether you can get away with wearing them, and what to do if you
   accidentally bought a racist one.

   _[4]'Seductive Squaw'_
   Do not wear this costume. First, no matter what the [5]makers of this
   costume tell you, "squaw" is not a acceptable term. Second, when the
   entirety of your costume is "I am a person of a different race, LOL," that
   qualifies as a racist costume. If you accidentally bought this costume,
   chuck it. Possible exception: You are going in a large group that includes
   Peter Pan, Wendy, and Tinkerbell. Just make sure you _do not_ lose sight of
   the group, and be aware that seducing a man dressed as cowboys will be
   misconstrued. [Yandy via [7]TBD, [8]Yandy]

   _Eskimos_
   On one hand, they're not called "Eskimo" anymore, but "Inuit." On the other,
   this costume is so far removed from its source material that it's hard to
   draw a straight line between it and the mockery of native northern peoples.
   The main problem with this costume is that it's nonsensical. Only wear it if
   you plan on doing a ton of blow. [Yandy]

   _Geisha_
   Geishas are a cohesive enough cultural phenomenon, and if you were to
   actually dress like a geisha--[10]with multiple layers of floor-length
   kimono and little white toe socks--that is fine. But are you _really_ going
   to dress like a geisha, or are you going to dress like a teenage victim of
   sexual trafficking giving happy endings in some crummy massage parlor in San
   Jose? You can probably get away with this kind of "geisha," too, but I urge
   you to resist. If you want to be a whore for Halloween, just be a whore, and
   skip the creepy racial overtones. Possible exception: This "[11]Japanese
   Entertainer Costume" is almost--but not entirely--self-aware. [Yandy]

   _'Asian Doll'_
   Whereas geishas occupy a grey area ([13]Oscar-winning movies have that
   effect), mishmash pan-Asian "doll" costumes get a resounding "nay." Ditto
   "[14]Asian Costume," "[15]Sexy Asian Girl," and this "[16]Chinese Take Out
   Costume." (That last one is just begging for gross jokes about "eating
   out.") Do not wear these costumes. Possible exception: You are an Asian
   female who likes to spend Halloween confronting fetishistic creeps and
   making them uncomfortable. Proceed with caution, though, because that joke
   can backfire. [Yandy]

   _Vikings_
   Vikings don't exist anymore, so it's fine to dress up like them. Bigotry is
   acceptable when it's about ancient peoples of yore. We know it's OK to dress
   up like Vikings because, whereas people are always up in arms about sports
   teams with Native American mascots, nobody cares at all about the Minnesota
   Vikings' mascot, unless it's for the purpose of a Brett Favre joke. Which
   reminds me: If you dress up like a Viking, be prepared to be accosted by a
   bunch of [18]exposed-penis Favres all night. [Yandy, [20]Yandy]

   _[21]'Harem Girl'_
   Do you really want to be in a harem, a female plaything of Middle Eastern
   polygamy? As long as the harem pant trend is going strong, I guess we should
   address this: Do not dress as a "harem girl," especially if your costume
   requires some inappropriately sexualized approximation of hijab. You may,
   however, dress as the main character from [22]I Dream of Jeannie. She was
   just a pan-Orientalist white girl, anyway. The "[23]Playboy Harem Girl
   Costume," meanwhile, is unintentionally funny. You can wear that if you're
   doing some kind of cheeky take on _The Girls Next Door_. [24]Bigamy on TV:
   [25]So hot right now.

   _[28]'White Russian Beauty'_
   [29]Yandy.com appears to have changed the name of the "White Russian Beauty"
   costume to "Russian Costume." (Is that better or worse? At least the
   original was an alcoholic beverage, and thus perhaps a pun costume.) More
   than anything, this costume is inaccurate: The sickle and hammer logo on the
   hat is out of date, and everyone knows "sexy Russians" have [30]red hair and
   do their seducing in lingerie, not figure skating costumes. If you already
   bought this costume, douse yourself in alcohol and go as the beverage
   instead. [Yandy]

   _Heidi Ho_
   The buxom beer-swilling bar maid is pervasive. Though Germans continue to
   protest it, they've got a lot worse to deal with these days, so I'm going to
   give in on the "St. Pauly Girl," the "Heidi Ho," and the "Sexy Oktoberfest."
   You are free to wear this costume and get beer and pretzels tossed down your
   cleavage all night, if that's your bliss. [Yandy, [33]Yandy]

   _Nazis_
   Do not dress up like a Nazi. This costume is especially ill-advised if you
   are the prince of England, a [34]Republican nominee for Congress, or a
   [35]reality star who just broke the heart of America's sweetheart. If you
   already bought your Nazi costume, go to hell. OK, fine, you could also tell
   everyone you're not a Nazi, but Prince Harry dressed up as a Nazi. But if
   you run into anyone dressed up as the Bear Jew, look out.

   _French Maids_
   French isn't a race, but it is a nationality, so is this costume offensive?
   No, it is not, just embarrassingly unoriginal, and maybe a little gross in a
   "I know way too much about my random acquaintances' sexual fantasies, now"
   sort of way. This costume is damaging only to your personal dignity.

   _'Grecian Goddess'_
   Another costume that isn't offensive so much as it is stupid. Togas are easy
   to make and easily identifiable--why would you waste your money on a bland
   white dress like this? Anyway, the Greek-American faction must have decided,
   at some point, to just leave the toga stuff alone and let oversexed college
   kids run amok with "Greek life," so this is fine, if pointless. [Yandy]

   _Bed Intruder Costume_
   Even without funny costumes, the Antoine Dodson phenomenon has been
   [39]likened to minstrelsy, so this is dangerous territory. Will the
   inevitable onslaught of Bed Intruder Halloween costumes veer dangerously
   [40]towards blackface? Now, it is certainly possible to pay tribute to an
   eccentric internet character without being racist, but the coming cavalcade
   of frat boys hollering "Hide yo wife!" is making me cringe already, so let's
   just make a collective choice to use our Bed Intruder costumes [41]on dogs
   only, because animals dressed like humans are always cute, but humans
   dressed like other humans is such a mess. [BedIntruder]
