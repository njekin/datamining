I'm not worried about what you did before the non-compete went into effect - I'm worried about what's going on right now (i.e. after the non-compete went into effect). 
 
I'll take a look at the e-mail once you send it. Hopefully we won't have any issues. 
 
I'll be in touch

I'll forward you the exact email I sent to Blink and you can decide for yourself if you think it's a problem. Personally, without the benefit of a legal education, I don't see how anything I said could be construed as violating a non-compete that wasn't even in effect yet.

First, tell her to piss off . . . you've severed business ties at her request, remember? You don't have to forward her anything. 


Second, I need to know if her accusations have an weight to them. Who exactly is Blink (I'm assuming a card shop) and did you have anything to do with thier decrease in business with Pickle? If not, no problem - just ignore her and be thankful she's out of your life. But if you are connected somehow, I need to know b/c the dissolution agreement did have a non-compete. You don't want to violate that provision . . . it'll lead to a huge headache. 


Anyway, definately don;t forward anything to Pickle. Just fill me in on what's going on and we'll tighten things up so you'll have nothing to worry about. 


How's that $40,000 treating you? 
  
PEace out

The last few days, Pickle has been asking me about one her big clients, Blink, she said they only ordered $500 worth of cards this month when they usually order $3,000. She thinks I somehow interfered. She wants me to forward her all my contact with them since the break-up. What do I do?
