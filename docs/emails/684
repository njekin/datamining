What have you been doing the past few days/week? Haven;t heard from you in a while - fill me in on what's going on in life. We need ot have another dinner with you and your new woman (if you haven't run her off yet).

Give her a few more days and then let me know if she still hasn;t contacted you. If not, I'll put my lawyer hat back on and contact her for you.
