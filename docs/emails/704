One or two days after we split, I informed them to contact you from now on. That is all the contact I've had.

Boone, I called Blink because I hadn't heard from them about their November order yet and they said they only wanted $500 in cards this month. You know the average Blink order is around $3,000. Have you said anything to them? You know you aren't allowed to interfere with my business Boone. What did you do?
