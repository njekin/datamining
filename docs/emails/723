I haven't done anything to interfere with your business.

Boone, I called Blink because I hadn't heard from them about their November order yet and they said they only wanted $500 in cards this month. You know the average Blink order is around $3,000. Have you said anything to them? You know you aren't allowed to interfere with my business Boone. What did you do? 

Charlotte "Pickle" Harris, Owner
