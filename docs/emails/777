That's what I said. She didn't list her time at all. She just said "phone calls, emails, drafting = 15 hours". What kind of lawyer thinks they can get away with that?

Yeah, she's probably full of crap on that bill. There's no way she spent that much time working this deal unless she counts all the "girltime" she likely spent with Pickle as they discussed how to best screw you out of your money. I put in a little over 7 hours, and that's just because they were such a pain in the tail. 
 
Do this - Tell her you want a detailed, down to the 1/10 of the hour time sheet that specifically ntoes what she did. Let me know when she sends it to you.

But she wants 2250, so my half is 1125. I guess that's unreasonable because I know she didn't do $1,000 worth of work on my behalf, maybe Pickle. She claims 15 hours. How many hours did you put in?
