Still waiting on them to get the check sent (or at least to send me a confirmation). They said they would notify me when the check clears into your account. 
 
Let me know when Gem sends her final bill to you (recall you owe half of it). 
 
Keep me posted on things . . . there are always a few mop up issues to deal with so keep me in the loop on everthing that's going on.  
 
 
Seven more months till New Zealand - may never come back. 
 
PEace out
