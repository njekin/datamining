Hey Boone,

I met up with Callie and reviewed the samples. I liked the “candy cane” one the best. I gave her all the details for the invitations. She told me that she gave you all the info. I just wanted to make sure you got it and see about payment and such.

Thanks,
Katie

	Katie,
	
	I have already provided to Callie the samples you will need in selecting your final order. I look forward to hearing back from you. If those samples are not satisfactory, then I will strive to find you new ones immediately, but I hope you trust my judgment thus far. It has been a pleasure dealing with you thus far and I hope you will continue to look to Simply Stated for all your stationery needs in the future.
