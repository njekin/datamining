	Dear Boone,
	
	Callie Purnia told me to e-mail you about possibly ordering some
	invitations. I serve on the board for a local non-profit agency,
	Compassionate Hearts. CH holds a holiday gala every year to raise money for
	the programming for the following year. This year's gala is on Friday,
	December 17. Unfortunately, I have let time slip away in ordering this
	year's gala invitations. I was talking to Callie about this, and she said
	you might be able to help. I really need something ordered, printed, and
	delivered in about 2 weeks. Could you help me out? Here are the details.
	
	Event: 13th Annual Compassionate Hearts Holiday Gala
	Date: Friday, December 17, 2010
	Time: 7:00 PM
	Location: Hilton Downtown Knoxville
	Address: 501 W. Church Avenue
	
	We also need an RSVP card, similar to that for a wedding invitation. We need
	500 invitations. As far as they style, something holiday looking and
	classic. At this point, I don't have time to be too picky.
	
	I know this is a big project to give you on such short notice. Please let me
	know your thoughts!
	
	Sincerely,
	Tiffany Zoria
