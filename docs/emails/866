Also, if you get Tiffany's job, she might even invite us to the gala. Wouldn't that be fun to get dressed up and have a night out? Well I think it would be. I'm always looking for an excuse to put on a nice dress.

You love Five Guys :) I've only eaten there once. These attorneys I used to work for ate at Five Guys about once a week. I always refused to go with them, although it was hard.

It was delicious. Just a little unfilling. Nothing like a five guys

I had one of those sonic burgers they keep advertising. I'm a sucker for tv ads. If it looks good on tv, you can just about guarantee I'll end up eating it.

I think we are very connected. Spiritually, metaphysically, and whatever else iscially you can think of.

Yes!!! That's exactly what I'm talking about. So funny that you knew what I was thinking. That seems to happen a lot these days ;)

Are you talking about the one Davis is running against Desjarlais? I couldn't believe my ears. 




Random thought, but I'm watching the news, and these political ads are getting a little out of control. I don't usually watch the dinnertime news. Apparently that's when most of the ads are.

Thanks again for all your help with the business. I think we are getting really close to a settlement with Sassy.

I spoke to my friend Erica today, and she said that she sent you an e-mail. I will give you a warning -- Erica is a really nice lady, but she is a stickler for a good deal. She practices law on her own, so she cannot afford to spend a fortune on stationery. I told her you would give her a good deal. I know you won't let me down!

I haven't heard anything from her in a few days. Can I just give you the samples she and I talked about? I don't want to pressure her.

That would be awesome. I'll make sure she is completely satisfied with them. I certainly don't want to make you look bad, if that's even possible.

FYI: I have a friend who might be interested in ordering some invitations from you. She has a big Christmas party every year, and I told her that she should let you do her invitations. Her name is Katie. She said she would get in touch with you.

If you want to come to the Halloween party with me, we should come up with a good couple's costume. Got any ideas?

Subject: Blink order

On Friday, Blink! Urban Fashions, one of Sassy's biggest customers, called to place an order with Sassy Sentiments but I told them I couldn't place the order for them. I told them they would have to talk to Pickle. When they asked why, I just said that she is handling all new orders, but I might have also hinted that I wasn't sure she'd be able to fill them. As soon as I said it I knew I shouldn't have, but now it's really eating at me. I had to tell someone. Thanks for being there for me. 

Boone
