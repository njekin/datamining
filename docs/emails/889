Dear Boone,

Callie Purnia told me to e-mail you about possibly ordering some invitations. I serve on the board for a local non-profit agency, Compassionate Hearts. CH holds a holiday gala every year to raise money for the programming for the following year. This year's gala is on Friday, December 17. Unfortunately, I have let time slip away in ordering this year's gala invitations. I was talking to Callie about this, and she said you might be able to help. I really need something ordered, printed, and delivered in about 2 weeks. Could you help me out? Here are the details.

Event: 13th Annual Compassionate Hearts Holiday Gala
Date: Friday, December 17, 2010
Time: 7:00 PM
Location: Hilton Downtown Knoxville
Address: 501 W. Church Avenue

We also need an RSVP card, similar to that for a wedding invitation. We need 500 invitations. As far as they style, something holiday looking and classic. At this point, I don't have time to be too picky.

I know this is a big project to give you on such short notice. Please let me know your thoughts!

Sincerely,
Tiffany Zoria
