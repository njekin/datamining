1.    Questions Not to Ask Police, #47 <http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/questions-not-to-ask-police-47.html> 

"Are there any warrants out for my arrest?"

That's one question that you should strongly consider not asking the police, or at least not asking in person. It's just awkward if the answer turns out to be yes.

This happened in Cincinnati last Friday <http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39580369/ns/us_news-weird_news/> , when an officer reported that a 44-year-old woman had flagged him down and asked him if there were any warrants out for her arrest. Told that indeed there was one, she then took off running. She now faces a charge of resisting the arrest she precipitated in the first place.

2.    2010 Ig Nobel Prize Winners Announced <http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/2010-ig-nobel-prize-winners-announced.html> 

I'm a big fan of the Ig Nobel Prize(s), awarded every year by the editors of the magazine Annals of Improbable Research <http://improbable.com/> . At least a few of this year's winners <http://improbable.com/ig/winners/> conducted research that might be of some distant relevance to the law, which gives me an excuse to mention them.

*	The Physics Prize went to three researchers at the University of Otago in New Zealand, for research demonstrating that slips and falls occur less often in winter if people wear their socks on the outside of their shoes. See "Preventing Winter Falls: A Randomised Controlled Trial of a Novel Intervention <http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/122-1298/3683/> ," Lianne Parkin, Sheila Williams, and Patricia Priest, 122 N.Z. Med. J. (No. 1298) at 31-38 (July 3, 2009). Could be relevant to comparative negligence if this knowledge becomes widespread. 
*	The Peace Prize went not to President Obama <http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/no-repeat-for-obama-on-nobel-prize.html>  but to three researchers at Keele University in the UK, for confirming that swearing in response to a painful event does indeed make you feel better. See "Swearing as a Response to Pain <http://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/abstract/2009/08050/swearing_as_a_response_to_pain.4.aspx> ," Richard Stephens, John Atkins, and Andrew Kingston, 20 Neuroreport (No. 12) at 1056-60 (2009). This seems generally useful to the practice of law, and in many other situations. 
*	Three Italian mathematicians won the Management Prize for demonstrating that organizations would become more efficient if they either promoted people entirely at random or sometimes deliberately promoted people believed to be incompetent.  See "The Peter Principle Revisited: A Computational Study <http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0455> ," Alessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda, and Cesare Garofalo, 389 Physica A (No. 3) at 467-72 (Feb. 2010). This has nothing whatsoever to do with law firms, except that one of those two options might explain how I got to be a partner.

All the other winning studies are worth a look, especially if you have any interest in whale phlegm, fruit-bat love, or the medical uses of roller coasters.

3.    Warning: Open Windows Can Be Hazardous <http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/warning-open-windows-can-be-hazardous.html> 

They can even be hazardous, at least according to the label discussed here <http://www.cjac.org/blog/2010/10/wacky-warnings-are-everywhere/index.html> , if they are only eight inches wide and are located seven feet above the floor.

Granted, an infant might come along with a seven-foot ladder and end up plummeting out the window on the other side, but (like people who are asleep <http://www.loweringthebar.net/2006/08/nj_appeals_cour.html> ) written warnings don't seem to do infants much good anyway.

4.    Two Ways to Get the President's Attention <http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/two-ways-to-get-the-presidents-attention.html> 

Author's Note:

Alternative titles you may prefer, depending on your politics:

Somebody Finally Throws the Book at Obama 

   or

Public Still Eager to Donate to Democrats 

I make an effort to be non-partisan, so please select from the above as you see fit.

President Obama had an eventful campaign appearance in Philadelphia on Sunday.

First, somebody threw a book at him. As you can see in the video <http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/two-ways-to-get-the-presidents-attention.html>  and the closeup below, the book actually sailed by Obama's head, although it's difficult to tell how close it was. Obama does not seem to have noticed the literary missile, but he was facing the other way.

You will not be surprised to hear that the Secret Service interviewed the book-thrower, but agents determined that the man did not mean the President any harm (possibly because it was a paperback?). According to one report, a Secret Service spokesman said the man was just an "overexuberant" author who "had written [a] book and hoped the president would read it."  

I guess that's one way to get a reader's attention. 

  <http://kevinunderhill.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451bd4469e20134882ab917970c-popup> It appears that no one has yet been able to determine what book was thrown (although there has been lots of speculation). This closeup (right) appears to show the back of the book, unfortunately, but maybe there are others. One report gave the overexuberant author's name as "Michael Lohan" (presumably, not Lindsay's father), but there is no work by any such person listed on Amazon, at least. If anyone figures this out, please let me know.

At the same rally, a naked man ran through the crowd, apparently as part of a publicity stunt for a website. Reports said that "billionaire and social media guru <http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/10/11/rally-shenanigans-book-thrown-at-obama-naked-man-arrested/> " Alki David had promised $1 million to the first person who streaked at an Obama rally, provided that <http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/man-streaks-front-obama-1-million_501259.html>  the streaker (1) got within visual range and earshot of the President, (2) had the name of a particular website written on his chest, (3) successfully screamed the name of said website at least six times, and (4) was naked. As that same report noted (I'm sparing you the pictures), at least two of those requirements were met.

But don't be surprised if a legal dispute is in the making. "We're waiting to review all the video footage and we'll be back with a statement tomorrow," David said <http://www.philly.com/philly/news/104710884.html?cmpid=15585797> . "Whether he was in earshot and eye[sight] of the President is what's being debated right now." To me, that sounds like there may have been some wiggle room in terms of whether the streaker only had to get close enough to be potentially seen and heard by Obama, or whether there has to be some evidence that Obama actually saw and heard him. A requirement to be within someone's "eyesight," at least, would seem to require the latter.

I guess the lesson there is to have a lawyer review the terms of any contract before deciding to run toward the President naked.

It appears that, unlike the shoe-throwing incident <http://www.loweringthebar.net/2008/12/iraqi-shoethrower-treated-as-hero.html>  in Iraq where President Bush successfully ducked a couple of loafers, neither of these acts was intended as a protest. The book-thrower just wanted to get his message across, and the streak-arranger just wanted publicity. "You marry a naked person and Mr. Obama together in one event and it's very good," David was quoted as saying, and it seems hard to argue with that. "I have to make it very clear, however," he continued, "that I'm quite a fan of the President.  It has nothing to do with him."

5.    One Possibly Unforeseen Risk of Escaping While Handcuffed <http://www.loweringthebar.net/2010/10/one-possibly-unforeseen-risk-of-escaping-while-handcuffed.html> 

-- is that you might also get charged with stealing the handcuffs.

  <http://kevinunderhill.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451bd4469e20134881fc51d970c-pi> According to the Longview (Wash.) Daily News <http://www.koinlocal6.com/s/-l3Hw3CCakeJhK4iW38_Hw.cspx> , a man who was arrested on October 1 managed to escape while being taken to jail, after he was able to get the car door open even though his hands were cuffed behind his back. He fled, and as of October 9 he was still at large.

The escape added at least two charges to the felony charge the man was already facing.

First, the report says that after a search failed to locate the man, a judge issued a warrant for his arrest "on suspicion of first-degree escape." But I see a couple of problems with that.

Under Washington law, a person is guilty of first-degree escape only if "he or she knowingly escapes from custody or a detention facility while being detained pursuant to a conviction . . . ." Rev. Code Wash. § 9A.76.110 <http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.76.110> . Setting aside my questions about how somebody might unknowingly escape from custody (sleepwalking?), that doesn't apply here because the escapee had not yet been convicted. At worst, this is second-degree escape <http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.76.120> . The other problem is with saying he's being sought "on suspicion of escape." Well, he is gone, right? Do you think he might still be in the car somewhere, maybe stuck down in the seat cushions?

Second, maybe because of the issues with this "escape" charge, according to the report police also want to charge the suspect with third-degree theft <http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.050> , on the grounds that when he ran off, he still had their handcuffs. (The cuffs were reportedly valued at only $29, which is what would make it a third-degree offense.) Very creative, but that's not going to work, either.

There are different kinds of theft, but they all require acting "with intent to deprive <http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.020> " the victim of property. And acting with "intent" means <http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.08.010>  acting "with the objective or purpose to accomplish a result." So unless there is some reason to think that the guy got himself arrested as part of a cunning plan devised for the purpose of escaping with a pair of genuine $29 police handcuffs, I don't think this qualifies as a "theft." Probably he would have preferred to escape without the handcuffs, in fact. For all they know, the guy is planning to FedEx their handcuffs back to them at the earliest opportunity.

Verdict: probably guilty of second-degree escape, presumed innocent on the handcuff-theft charge.
