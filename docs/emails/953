	It would be my pleasure to help you design a lasting logo. Even something as simple as ER with a sophisticated font could help differentiate your firm. My company can help you do this with minimal cost.

&gt; Hi Boone,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My name is Erica Rust, and I am a friend of Callie. She told me that you<br>
&gt; are<br>
&gt; starting up a new personalized stationery business and that you would be<br>
&gt; able to give me a good deal on some stationery for my business. I am a solo<br>
&gt; practitioner attorney, and I work out of my home. I am in need of several<br>
&gt; types of stationery. First, I need some general stationery to print<br>
&gt; letters.<br>
&gt; These letters will be sent to clients, other attorneys, and courts. Second,<br>
&gt; I need some note cards that I can write personal, handwritten messages on.<br>
&gt; Finally, I need some holiday greeting cards to send to my clients and<br>
&gt; colleagues. I would like something simple and cheap, yet professional. I<br>
&gt; would probably need about 1,000 sheets of general stationery, 200 note<br>
&gt; cards, and 100 holiday cards. Please tell me what other information I need<br>
