hahahaha that is funny to think about! I also went back to my high school for a football game earlier this fall. It was the first game I had been to since HS graduation. It's funny how everything there stays the same, yet I felt so different.

I get the same feeling whenever I go back to my old Jr High. I thought I was such as big deal then but now, standing in the same gym, I just feel like my old middle school self, and my voice fails in front of all those kids who, like me, just want to make a name for themselves.

I mean to tell you when we talked earlier -- My Junior League meeting was at an elementary school tonight. It was actually the school I grew up attending. It was so strange to be back there. The gym used to seem HUGE and now it seems tiny! It was surreal.

In July 1975, Erskine Lawrence Ebbin was knocked off his moped and killed by a taxi in Hamilton, Bermuda. It was the same taxi with the same driver, carrying the same passenger, that had killed his brother Neville in July the previous year. Both brothers were 17 when they died, and had been riding the same moped in the same street.
