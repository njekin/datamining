Better route it through my box just to be official. I'm get it to Gem and we'll have this ordeal put to bed.

I am really quite satisfied with this result. I know I couldn't have done it without you brother. I won't forget this anytime soon. I don't get off work until after 5 so look for this in your box tomorrow morning unless you want me to send it straight to Pickle.

Good news, we've got a contract sealing the deal. You'll get $45,000 outright from Pickle, your captial account back ($5,500), and we got the non-compete cut down to three states. I've attached the document for you to sign. I need you to print it out, sign were indicated, and then put it in my lawschool mail box (which I keep as an alternate for my business - no solicitations in that box). I'll then pass it on to Gem for Pickle to sign, and then you can just wait for your fat check.  


You ended up getting a fairly good deal. Glad you ended up with some good cash.

You think we'll get this wrapped up today? I'm very disappointed in them for taking this long.

Still waiting on Gem and Pickle's reply. Waiting on women - the story of my life.

In July 1975, Erskine Lawrence Ebbin was knocked off his moped and killed by a taxi in Hamilton, Bermuda. It was the same taxi with the same driver, carrying the same passenger, that had killed his brother Neville in July the previous year. Both brothers were 17 when they died, and had been riding the same moped in the same street.
