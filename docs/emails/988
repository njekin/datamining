Katie,

I have already provided to Callie the samples you will need in selecting your final order. I look forward to hearing back from you. If those samples are not satisfactory, then I will strive to find you new ones immediately, but I hope you trust my judgment thus far. It has been a pleasure dealing with you thus far and I hope you will continue to look to Simply Stated for all your stationery needs in the future. 

Boone
