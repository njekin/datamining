Erica,

It would be my pleasure to help you design a lasting logo. Even something as simple as ER with a sophisticated font could help differentiate your firm. My company can help you do this with minimal cost.

Boone

No, I really don't. I'm on my own, so I've just been piecing it together
over the past few years. If you could help me out with that too, it would be
great! I'd really like for everything to match and look professional. That's
all I am really concerned about.

Thanks for your help,
Erica
