Mel Kiper tonight said that the Tn/Bama game was a waste of his time. I hope we prove him wrong.

hahaha! It does kind of look like that. Apparently they are going to wear them for the Bama game.

I do not watch FNL, so maybe I don't get it. At first I thought that was some little kid's jersey.

Have you seen this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBAY7xNcTiA
Do you watch Friday Night Lights? If so, you will understand the awesomeness of this video.

Thanks again for all your help with the business. I think we are getting really close to a settlement with Sassy.

I spoke to my friend Erica today, and she said that she sent you an e-mail. I will give you a warning -- Erica is a really nice lady, but she is a stickler for a good deal. She practices law on her own, so she cannot afford to spend a fortune on stationery. I told her you would give her a good deal. I know you won't let me down!

I agree with everything you said...or didn't say.

I haven't heard anything from her in a few days. Can I just give you the samples she and I talked about? I don't want to pressure her.

I wouldn't have referred her to you unless I knew you would do a good job. I hope it works out!

That would be awesome. I'll make sure she is completely satisfied with them. I certainly don't want to make you look bad, if that's even possible.

FYI: I have a friend who might be interested in ordering some invitations from you. She has a big Christmas party every year, and I told her that she should let you do her invitations. Her name is Katie. She said she would get in touch with you.

I think I'll just let you handle this and try not to be too big of a prude with my veto power.

If you want to come to the Halloween party with me, we should come up with a good couple's costume. Got any ideas?

Subject: Blink order

On Friday, Blink! Urban Fashions, one of Sassy's biggest customers, called to place an order with Sassy Sentiments but I told them I couldn't place the order for them. I told them they would have to talk to Pickle. When they asked why, I just said that she is handling all new orders, but I might have also hinted that I wasn't sure she'd be able to fill them. As soon as I said it I knew I shouldn't have, but now it's really eating at me. I had to tell someone. Thanks for being there for me. 

Boone
