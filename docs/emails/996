Anytime. I'm a big fan of taking breaks when I have something I'm working on.

I'm glad you got to come over tonight, even though it was for just a few minutes. I really needed a study break. Apparently, third year law students are supposed to be bored to death. I haven't quite had that experience yet.

By the way, I don't even know if I mentioned it to you, but I have Fall Break on Thursday and Friday. I'm going to do lots of work (at least I hope to), but I'll also have some free time to see you!

Are we still on for tomorrow? I'm all set to make my deadlines and be able to relax all afternoon with you before you head out of town.

Boone
