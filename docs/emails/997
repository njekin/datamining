I'm going to head to bed here in a few. Thanks for the fun conversation tonight! Hopefully I'll see you tomorrow evening for dinner.

In July 1975, Erskine Lawrence Ebbin was knocked off his moped and killed by a taxi in Hamilton, Bermuda. It was the same taxi with the same driver, carrying the same passenger, that had killed his brother Neville in July the previous year. Both brothers were 17 when they died, and had been riding the same moped in the same street.
