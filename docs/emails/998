I mean to tell you when we talked earlier -- My Junior League meeting was at an elementary school tonight. It was actually the school I grew up attending. It was so strange to be back there. The gym used to seem HUGE and now it seems tiny! It was surreal.

In July 1975, Erskine Lawrence Ebbin was knocked off his moped and killed by a taxi in Hamilton, Bermuda. It was the same taxi with the same driver, carrying the same passenger, that had killed his brother Neville in July the previous year. Both brothers were 17 when they died, and had been riding the same moped in the same street.
