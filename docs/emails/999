	Hi Boone,
	
	My name is Katie, and I am a friend of Callie's from law school. She
	mentioned that you are starting a stationary company and that you are
	looking for customers. I have a Christmas party every year, and I would be
	interested in seeing what types of personalized invitations you have. I'm
	looking to order about 50. How much would you charge?
	
	Thanks,
	Katie
